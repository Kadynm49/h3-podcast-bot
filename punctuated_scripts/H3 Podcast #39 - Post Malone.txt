You know When in Rome, you don't have like a douche flute or a mouth for Dora. You got a big one, a douche flute, it's first of all, okay. What would you call the giant? Babe I? Don't know it's got it. The Canon has to be the what's the first trade, it's kind of have more of an alliteration or rhyming, not really cuz mouth fedoras kind of just I'm have to think on that yeah. It's like a [, __ ] douche pack had it like a camel back and have it that thing I, don't know if I talked about it yet was so [ __ ] heavy. Do we talk about when we first got out on the street? We had this prop company built it, and then we out to Hollywood to film and the moment I put it on I swear to god. It's like 80 pounds, and the moment I put on I was like oh, my [, __, ] god. How am I gonna make it through this day, I saw Dan coming up the escalator to meet us and he was like holding it and I was like what is this guy [ __, ], exaggerating how heavy this thing is. I put it on. I was like I, don't know how I get through this day after five minutes the strap broke. It's just completely buckled under its weight. It was pretty dramatic day we had to go to like it was the hottest day. Yeah you look great I feel yeah, that's nice! That's right! I kept that by the way you should treat yourself. Yeah I kept that Queen I'm waiting, I'm, hoping honestly I can't wait for us to go to Vegas I want a gun, I'm gonna, wear that now that I have good shoes. Yes, you always show me up so yeah I. Think I. Think Vegas is like my escape from the norm, because I get to wear fun, stuff, I'm gonna buy a matching suit. You guys should. If we ever have low, be cute, a red-carpet event won't go wearing matching Gucci track suits. Is he super cute? You guys are killing it I'm, so happy you're killing it did I tell you. Speaking of Vegas. Did I tell you that story about when I won like 95 grand. This is a new story. I think no okay, so I was in Vegas. This isn't like a nice anecdote. I love that no yeah. This is a great nice anecdote from Vegas. Those are rare, yeah yeah! No, it's not! Nice I beat, but it's a great story. That's a nice story, but it's not nice because it just shows the ignorance of me. Okay, so here's the deal so I go. It's like you know: I usually go like 15 grand ready to go cash, ready to play, and so I I. We were playing blackjack. My mom was there and I think she was there. I, don't know if she was there, maybe not okay, so sat down at this blackjack table right at 14,000, I played it all up and down whatever, but along the way I gave some money to Jason. You know Jason, my friend he lives with me. He's the ER yeah yeah and I gave him a hundred bucks. He lost that hand and then I gave him another hundred and he started winning and at that time I was still playing. My like 14 grand right and so up and down I lost it all. I, say Jason, give me 100 bucks and then I lose that exactly I got it. I gotta get a return on my investment and then I lose that I tell him. Give me another hundred bucks and I've that hundred dollar I sat at the table for 14 hours play had like 50 screwdrivers worked my way up from $100 to 95 thousand dollars so and I said: okay. As soon as I get two hundred thousand I'm walking away gamblers fallacy I'm walking away at a hundred thousand ninety-five I was like it was crazy. They had like five thousand dollar chips. I just had a shitload of them. Interestingly, the more money you have on the table, the less chips it looks like you, yeah yeah, yeah yeah. There were like British colors that I started, saying at the British national anthem, like LED lights and yeah, so I, 95 thousand okay, I'm gonna play til, a hundred thousand went down to five thousand dollars and then I went all the way back up to ninety five thousand dollars. Not how long did that take 14 hours, I didn't get up, I did not move, I was just drinking and every time I would win. Cuz I was playing like $10,000 hands and then doubling the crowd. Yeah I was big. It was a big time for section. Oh okay, so you were at High. Roller is a scam, yeah I, don't like it! There act normal I, don't like it there. The max bet was like was 10,000 yeah. You know what the high rollers places it's just sad who's like the press. Oh it is the person there's nobody's there. There's all these gambling addicts who come and like lose their [, __ ] yeah, it's crazy! It's crazy, but yeah I mean I won that lost the 95 again playing vague and that's my story, but it was. It was really a rush. Every time I would win like a hand. I would literally take run up and take a lap around. It was the most intense thing of my life and it was a lot of sounds like no regrets there. Yeah I mean yeah twice two times two times and I didn't get that extra five just to get a hundred and walk away. So how did you imagine walking away with a hundred grand cash? You would have been up on that kiss. You know yeah a lifetime yeah. They would be following you back yeah. They were they. They yeah. It was they had like there were security gate like four security guards. They been like knocking at your door like hello, you know we're so open yeah we gotta come back, come on, I do feel walking away. Were you like, oh I'm, sad or were you like? That was a fact. It was very, but now I look back and I said: hey, that's pretty cool anyways! It's a great story! A great anecdote, great anecdote thanks for sure that hey you're, welcome, appreciate that dude I'm, so sore I feel like I. We started. We got a personal trainers. I can't do it looks great. Oh thanks. Doug he's only done one okay. When is it every day? I. Do it twice a week, I've done it twice: I I! Do it twice a week? It's the thing I've done in one week, but anyway, I'm so sore. I cannot even stand up. I like this thing of like where we're gonna get you more muscular I mean what you're like I can't [ __ ]. It I feel like I'm 19, oh yeah, yeah I'm, getting serious yeah yeah after show. I need to do like the like stretches, because it might like these things. These groin things right like the little like tendons right, that's my worst spot, because you do a lot of like kneeling and [ __ ] yeah. It's good exercise, it is yeah, I mean I'm, surprised, I mean I'm. So a thick boy, yeah yeah. What I mean think what for I? Never like I feel old, yeah. Well, you're busy you work a lot. I have a living playing call of duty, god mm-hmm you need to get on it. Yeah I was talking to you about that. I've, never I've, never played caught, I, never played battlefield or Cod or any of those console. Cod is fun. This one is fun. I've been seeing, I was thinking about buying and I saw mixed reviews. Almost farmer review, [ __ ] well see. The reviews you probably were reading was like very glitchy right right, a lot of what we're like it's not worth it by yet. Oh, it is now really yeah. We should play together: yeah geometry wars: oh [, __, ] I played like the first one you have yeah. So there's involved involved well like okay and the first one, it's just a flat plane and all these crazy waves right I, remember that anyway. So now that it's been evolved and it has a thing. So it's to the three why there's like freaking, trapezoids and pills, you're, all and globes is a skewed. Yes, good! Yes, there's skews! There's planes, damn dimension sounds very it's right. Really. In Ted we had a friend over I think we must have played it for like 10 hours, really yeah, really like Max 20 minute game, it's like peggle, so we should play cod or I. Don't know, I want to play pub G with you, but I want it up. So over that game, I want it's. The thing that really pisses me off is I always get killed by some [ __ ] hacker really, every time. How do you know they're hacking because they should be through three wall: I always landed, George, Paul and I'll, be inside of the inside of the crate and they'll shoot me through the crate. That's a [ __ ], it's [, __ ]! Well, there's no Pettit one time! I was playing yeah, there's no penetration know what time I was playing and I dropped from the sky, and none of the buildings rendered and I could see through all the walls and I could walk through walls. That's really good, so I so I did you were so let's so I was it. I should have right, like I'm walking through walls. I can see everyone I'm picking everything I'm about the best gear, I'm capping people through walls and [ __ ]. This is just no walls in the game, so there's a dude in the [ __ ] tree and I'm capping him through. Like a ten. You know, walls and you see through trees. Everything nothing existed. I know I couldn't see through trees, but I see him like Oh building. You know like this [ __ ], loser I lost like two walls and I'm trying to shoot him and it's a frustrating game. I love the game. My frustration comes from legitimate, kills, cuz yeah, I, never know where I'm being shot from yeah I guess the answer was hackers the whole time any time I lose yeah I mean, like reasons why you actually lose is like 1% and [ __ ] [ __ ] is 99% hackers. It's like a pie chart. Have you seen that pie chart? Yes, it's I live that pie. Chart right. We should play some, though you think you fun, I, think God, okay, I'm Arnie, like third prestige, that sounds very prestigious prestige over look where you can hang out with all your rich friends. Let's do that. Um I'd love to do that. Yeah! It's nice! It's good! Even I, wouldn't lead you wrong. I want to play. I want to play, play, let's wrap it up. I saw you the other day you on martha's snoop yeah. Why should that I have so many questions about it because I we mean ela or well I. Don't we're thinking a lot about how shows are made right, I'm, not gonna, say why and I'm wondering how people make it right first. My first question is: how long ago was that shot? I want to say it was a long time ago, okay months, okay, Oh -, maybe half a year, maybe mmm Wow, maybe five months, yeah, and so my next question is when you're there it's when they like do the audience reaction. It sounds like there's like a whole stadium of people there. There is a lot of people. There is hilarious, yeah um. There was a lot of people. There would, you say whole stadium yeah, but it was nice because everybody, you know, did you get to see the audience yeah yeah yeah, it's nice, okay, yeah did they cook? Did they actually cook their own food and wait mmm, so soup made that fish and it cooked for you cuz they cut out because they were like alright snoops gonna make this fish and put it in the oven. And then oh, my god, it's done immediately. So you were hanging out that whole time right. Well, it was more like a uh I'd say more like a cooking show. You know how like they show you how to make it already right and then so then they cook the one that they already made. That's exactly the same as got it yeah. So that was pre. Pour like pre-prepped I would say so: I, don't know yeah okay, but it was. They was delightful. It was a treat. It was a real treat being on the show yeah Matt Wendy. Oh we had that Wendy was super cool. Super super sweet Martha was super sweet. She liked my car, though I'm talking about that you give her a spin, make a pass. Did you stop? You take a pic from psycho. You stop short with my wife. Oh! Is that like whenever that's the mom arm yeah it's a wall in Seinfeld, it's a dad! It's like a boom, no no I mean in my life, it's Seinfeld! It's like you have a hot date and then you see a red light and then you act like you, don't see it and then you slam on the brake to stop short and you put your hand out. Okay, yeah. It's the same. It's the same concept except without the nod eNOS. In short, you could have just stopped short with Martha. Oh, she was driving, oh maybe she could stop. Everyone wants a couple. E's next I mean I've got stuff. I saw you were in ghost hunters, yeah Ghost, Adventures yeah. It's awesome. How would that go? Was it really spooky? It was crazy. It was crazy. They're gonna be here. We should do like a online special yeah I love because we went to that place and it was pretty spooky. We heard that voice, but this that, like the things that they get into, is really crazy and they have all the equipment and stuff like yes, well that guy's the real deal yeah I was surprised but how's it house a show called Ghost Adventures, Ghost Adventures, it's on History Channel, right travel travel, it's the number one show on droughts on travel, and it's on like the 30th, the season or some [ __ ], like what 17 now okay I mean. How many is there that many goes well I've been watching. The show since I was 12. Wow [Music] is that one of the most surreal yeah getting to meet Zach and he's such a good guy, and you know he lives in Vegas. So he always gambling have fun and that's cool and it was super cool used to ask my mom to stay up late watch. That's the doorman I get to go on it. The most surreal, like the celebrity cuz now you've met so many cool people. What are were the some of the most surreal like celebrity encounters you've had where you're like I cannot believe I'm hanging out with this guy just a lot of stuff from my childhood. You know what I mean like I got to hang out with the guys from a band called Escape. The Fate I used to listen to all the time and high school and stuff and meeting them was super sick I'm, like Chris, drew from nevershoutnever I, don't know if y'all know them, but I used to listen to him all the time and I just like started talking to him like hitting him up, and you know he said hi and also one time I DM the guy from Fleet Foxes, Robin Peck mode and that's my favorite band of all time and he responded back so just virtual winter dance, I think the most real experience you know getting a little DM back is meaningful. Yes, it is the most surreal one I've had probably is with Steve oh yeah like having steve-o, because before we shot that video with him, he came over to our house and we were in our living room like shooting the [ __ ] about YouTube, pranksters and stuff right and I was. It was just so [ __ ], sir cuz I grew up watching Jack like we all did right. Mm-Hmm Steve owes a legend one he's sitting in my living room when we're talking [ __ ], about like Fatali, making fun of this guy and I was just like so outside myself being like this is so weird hanging out with Steve right yeah. It's like you, don't even know yet to stop and say: [ __, ], yeah I, don't want to be weird, but it's just like what even is my life right now, man, alright, so it keeps hitting me up -, oh, so we need to do this. Video quick, our fans are always asking about it.

How could he react that fast, huh? Wait, it's just cycling between them. Is it, though yeah? Oh, my god you here. What is that creepy [ __ ] screen dude I have chosen that screen is so creepy.

Did he bait me into putting that like he expected my reaction to to show this on the podcast like well, if he was doing that, why would he just move behind the screen weird?

Put that back on the screen, because I'm frankly I'm terrified of what may actually pop up but Dan and backstage has it open. So if anything weird happens, we will update you guys, I just hope. It's a dis track. We were saying before it might be: I love that I'd actually don't have a lot of fun with that, but the fact that he checked out all those videos- that's pretty extreme, pretty dramatic, but it's been so long. It's like dude. The window is gone kind of right, so maybe not maybe that's just how long it takes to build like a nail bomb he's been working on. Oh he's got like he's, got this crazy disc track and then the footage is all like hidden camera footage peeking in our window at our house. What was that I guess? 50 cent went and checked up on someone I, don't remember who it was, but their mom at work. She was like napping and he was in there. I don't want to freaked out I, don't know so. Every time you've heard a little weird noise at night in our house. No, no! You know nothing like what not we all like do not get my head I'm, not talking about Patrice I'm talking about. Maybe it's just like a little crack yeah when the temperature goes down or Rises yeah nature, but we have another mystery to work through, explain that one okay. So today we came here to the office uh-huh and then the table over there. It was empty, except for this paper and no one knows no one knows where I came from fold: it up brand-new, a memo from 2012 about Mathnasium yeah, nothing easier, isn't Mathnasium like a math website, it's a yeah, that's a chain. They have brick-and-mortar stores folded up neatly on our table. The only person here was Dan and he you know he says it wasn't him. Well, that's a weird thing to have 2012 all employees. Bereavement pay is calculated based on the bit they're talking about bereavement, pay and then they're talking about jury, doo, doo, doo, dee, doo, doo doo. So what is it letter about? It's a memo. All employees who wish to take off due to the death of immediate family members should notify their superiors immediately. How many, how many people are dropping dead in the family here mo? Is this related? Why is it there? I? Don't know and I have no idea why it was like brand-new like just like you know one fold like that: what's on our desk, wasn't a wrinkled. What desk right outside that day at that coffee table, so who is it related to this dream? Well, no jokes aside, like I'm, really genuinely don't understand how this got there and he doesn't.

Is that a church who's buried in that house dude? What are you doing? That's a church! Oh my god! It's a [, __ ] Church! Is it no. Maybe it looks like Scott is like steeple yeah, but it looks very residential at the same time, there's a ladder in the back. It's very chairs! You were scared. What it's Patrice! If you're listening? Can you just? Can you correct that what's gonna be in the house dude? Should we watch this there we go. Where does he live? I have no [ __ ] I mean last I. I knew he was in LA, but this does not look like LA. Oh, this is a house. Oh no I'm, so terrified dude he's just gonna cut it off. So there's a ladder he's walking up behind a house. It's it looks very rural, looks very country, it's very, very stuttering. There's a lot of lag, I! Guess here's a pork there's another house right next to it. Let's, but it's kind of I mean it doesn't. Look like la it's a nice house for sure very wooded. Are we just gonna, see it dick all this and he's gonna like put in his pants or something? If he's he gonna go in this house to murder someone? Oh man at what point do we close this I mean it's not what he's going in? What do you think I? Don't know? You're goes I'm alone. How much can you tolerate I? Don't know this is gone. This is real though yeah yeah I mean ghosts are like one thing, but this is what is this blue [ __ ] there's a tarp? He walked around the back he's in the backyard. There's a zoomed he zoomed in on the garage. It's not your house, that's not my own Oh trust me I would be fired beyond he's zooming in slowly on some red object in the garage white you'll. Are you afraid of actually seeing something or you just think this is a waste? That's creepy! Why is there ladders everywhere on the house? There's literally ladders everywhere he's climbing up one of the ladders, but it looks like wait. He looks like a home-invasion thing. Cuz. He has a ladder going up to the balcony. No, but you could just walked up the stairs right, but yeah I, guess you're right. Why? What the [ __ ] dude do. I close this semester's, oh I, saw Han I, saw a hand, I saw Patricia's hand. It was a black told you. He was gonna cut it off, didn't I it'll be back. He tried he changed. The font, okay, I'm, not I, can't watch I saw his hand, it's definitely him cuz. We were saying: maybe it's a hacker, but I saw you guys. It was his hand, was a black man's hand. What there's only one black man, it's Patrice I mean it looked like. Oh my god. Alright, alright I'm gonna close this Dan Kim. Let us know if there's any updates. Oh my god, it's got a audience. So if you're gonna do some weird [ __ ] Patrice, we don't wait for that count. Then all right, I'm closing it. You lost your chance. Have you ever seen that? How do we move on past this I think we just do Patrice watch, let's do it, but tonight, let's, let's make him angry. Let's not! Let's, let's provoke him. These statements are endorsed by Austin wrote the script for the show. This is all endorsed by him all right. So did you hear about a hard hard shift here? 180? Have you heard about the new Star Wars game for iea yeah battle? Was it called - how it's like, apparently they're, just [ __ ] everybody over with DLCs? What do you mean? The game costs 80 bucks. First of all, the whole day. It's just to buy the retail copy, the normal game, yeah 80, bucks really, and so the normal is 60 when I actually am interested in playing this game by 80 bucks. It's like get real. Okay, no problem, so basically there's so much DLC in this eighty dollar game. It doesn't even include Darth Vader as a playable character. You have to either play for like a thousand plus hours to earn the credits to unlock him or pay like an additional 50 bucks to unlock him. Okay, there's 4000 plus dollars of DLC content to fully unlock this $80 game really 1600. Maybe I saw the collector's edition, but anyway, so everyone was complaining like services posted on reddit, so seriously he only pulled up I paid seriously, I paid, $80 selves, a door locked, and so the developers responded and this response has entered the internet Hall of Fame. It's the most disliked comped comment of all time: - 676 thousand good. They go. The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and an accomplishment for unlocking different heroes. Sips beer, as for cost, we selected initial values based upon the data from the open beta. Someone said: I wonder if I worked at Burger. If Burger King wants to sell me a sense of pride and accomplishment by making me work ten hours for my [ __, ] fries. So these and then, if that's, not bad enough, you know boogie right yeah, so he was streaming playing him to the game, enjoying it like a good boy trying to earn credits to unlock Vader or whoever else watch. This clip having a lot of fun more credits available in three hours. Wow, it's like an app. It's a proof, freemium we're! Sorry! You were enjoying our Kaede mode too much, so we have to stop giving you prizes. I'm. Sorry, I'm! Sorry, were you enjoying arcade mode, because you have to wait three hours now to get more credits out of arcade mode, what the [ __ ] so he's: [ __, ], [, __ ] me! What's that! Well, this $60 game is now being treated like a freemium mobile game. Yeah. Can you believe these four, these [ __ ] guys at EA? So this is it I'm? Boycott I actually really want to play this game. It looks really fun, but I, don't know I mean this said like I, don't like it then they're at love, Star Wars, but the thing that I don't like about it. Is you don't reload and that's what really pisses me off? You got. It adds a new element of strategy. Well, no yeah reloading is just satisfying and also its lasers, like I, want I want like ballistic all right. You know you know into the future. You want. You want gunpowder, it's the ground, yeah boots on the ground kind of guy yeah, but in the future certainly they'll have to reload I mean lasers. What you got a energy yeah, exactly reload your energy cells come on energy cell, get with it idiots. That's so anyway. I thought that was interesting. Yeah, that's crazy! It is a [ __ ]. It's like [, __, ], clash of clans or whatever yeah. It's clashing $60 clash of clans. Do we have any calls I guess not where I'm having a problem with discord? Eh? Is that what's going on out there? Oh yeah, how was a I thought? You were in idubbbz contact Cobb. Obviously, how was that he's awesome yeah? That was it was after that night I think, oh, so, the real that was fueled by real emotions and because he came he drove from here to LA to here or not LA, where he lives, hmm to her to Vegas, yeah and I had just gone to bed and like 10 minutes later, he calls me he barely has been knocking at my door. Oh he's such a good guy and his girlfriend is super sweet. That's awesome and that's cool rice gum used. Didn't he was like a rock star, something he's one of your songs and his response. Yeah with the with the money counter. Yes, yeah yeah she's good his lawyers on them, yeah Jake, Paul, there's a god that guy is like so drama prone. Man like there's this new beef, where the Martinez twins with these twink little Spanish boys, okay, yeah a spicy little twinks- oh god, I'd like to get them both together in a dark room behind a curtain. A couple ladders- probably probably their house- a couple ladders in the garage, but apparently he was like bowling them or some she he called them be nurse or something damn I was like. I was like they're, not even Mexican idiot they're Spanish! That's crazy! That's crazy! You hit me up recently, jakey yeah I think so he said sorry. If I offended, you and I said hey man, it's all good. Would they be offended like when we did the blood whenever he I guess when he came to my house? Oh okay, that's nice, but it was a very I felt like it was a very heartfelt apology and I said: okay, that's good! That's nice creig's! Definitely crazy! [, __ ], going on oh yeah! That guy can't get. Although his brother Logan it's like super start, I went to Dubai you I should pull all that crazy, crazy I feel weird watching those I. Don't know why cuz, it's all a bunch of kids and the way he just walks up there and he's like I know you all love me good I know like he doesn't. He doesn't have any discernible talent like he's, not singing he's, not dancing, no dope. What did I say singing singing he's he's not singing he's dancing, no none of those things, but he just walks out. There he's got no skill he's just like hey I'm, a guy on a stage and everyone's just like oh touch, my stop short with me, and he just he loves it. It's weird how willing he is to accept all the pubescent love. Do you know what I mean he'll, it's pretty weird: it's bro great Teen, Mania teen me it's a weird phenomenon: I got the sense that they bust some kids in from Dubai funding on us really yes to here. No because he did the world's largest fan meet right in Dubai and there was like 10,000 screaming adolescents there, but the whole thing was feel like no kids live in Dubai I feel like it's all like older ballers yeah. It's just ballers and slaves in like big-ass bottles of vodka, like this [ __ ] giant towers that those are the children's little big vodka bottles in like a stroller there, no I want to go, though it seems super fun, I'm scared there. They don't [ __ ] around they're like hardcore theocracy. You know if you stare at a lady wrong or so show too much shoulder there. They'll put you in an unmarked grave in an unmarked grave. What did I say? I thought she said, Audemars grave, because it's be very bothered. They're gonna ice, your grave out, but you know that's the problem. I, don't know I'm where I'm weird about Dubai cause like they legitimately have slave laborers there, because they bring in from Asian countries. Reportedly they steal their passport and don't let them leave and like building the what's the name of that giant building the Porsche whatever I. Don't know, but is that the building? That's in the clouds yeah, it's the tallest building the world by far that's [, __, ], crazy, and so, like thousands of immigrant workers, died. Building that thing like [, __, ], just words of people dying. There's literally, you know when you think of medieval castles like schools and bodies other day yeah, that's what that is or something like crazy. They just leave him there too. It's really weird leave them. There, yeah they're, just bodies that oh in medieval times, no that's at the boars it's crazy. Is there any way? No there's not graves are I status. [, __ ], though I'm ashamed for you. They're building, like artificial islands, see it's crazy over there man they have like an island shaped like a palm tree. I wonder if someday they'd just go broke and it's like the ultimate ghost town, just like the weirdest ghost town it like. Isn't it the richest place, I think so. Yeah they're killing it'd be fun yeah. It would be fun to go there. I am legitimately scared, those guys don't have like we get to fight Emirates, to get it and get like a whole room. Exactly hot shower. That's nice yeah! Let's switch it up here, let's, let's lighten it up here bit: oh my god: let's switch off of unmarked graves and get right into the goofs that sound like a diarrhea from real it is. You can see she looks over like [ __ ], this [ __ ] will not ruin my day. I love in her face like her mouth is watering like the minister, oh I, hate that feeling. Do you puke a lot? No I, don't puke a lot but I. You know what I'm gonna, puke yeah I peek readily yeah I mean you know when, like yeah I'm, sensitive guy, emotionally and physically, but that feeling when the water starts, building up yeah like a jolly rancher you're like [, __ ], you know what's happening. I'm gonna have to throw up. I, wasn't puked he's never puked yeah in your life mm-hmm, even as a baby. Well that she knows of okay, because that's like like semi-pro, you see that movie. No, like you never puked in your life, doctors were amazed, is Will Ferrell and frankly it to me. It's concerning I, remember once in college, you were super drunk and you felt really sick and I was worried about you and I was like to just puke and she's, like I, can't puke yeah. That's why I started shoving fingers down her throat to make her puke. We were at her friend's house and we went in the bathroom together lock the door. People are like: oh they're, probably [, __ ] I'm shoving my fingers down her throat trying to make her puke she she'd wanna puke and my all my time. No you've, never puke. It's concern. Yeah! That's crazy! You probably have a lot of toxins, I, don't know and I've gotten drunk to the point of like blacking out right. You know crazy when HeLa gets really drunk now it doesn't happen that often but like in New York, because the last time I got super drunk I blacked out and was pretty scary. It was horrifying, Kerry yard yeah in New York. We were hanging out with John and we were drinking this. Like sailor gin like 50% alcohol yard, so we were hitting that we got. We did like three shots and that's it oh yeah done and so she's blocked out. She can't even stand. I carry her up the reef flights, the stairs I'm I'm worried about her I, put her in the bed and because I know she can't puke she's just digesting at all and so I'm, not sleeping I. Just keep checking her pulsing [ __ ] right, you ever is that ever happen you someone's so drunk next to in the bed and you're like I, hope, no, okay, a unique experience, I just wake up to it if anything, yeah, but last time I threw it wasn't. Iceland, oh I woke up and I threw up all over the bed Oh like literally all over the bed, and it was. It was nasty. So you had puked and passed out and then woke up. No I I woke up, I passed out, woke up and then threw up and in the middle and I packed it up like Santa's like sack the bad boys yeah, this barf yeah throwing up sucks ass, I hate.

Don't think that I could ever swallow my own puke, I I've done it a little bit in it like to hold it back. No like a bourbon, oh yeah, yeah, but immediately yeah I've been there and that we know how bad it is right, but imaginal, oh yeah, you know what God for what's better, swallowing it or spitting it out on the stage spitting it out, there's more taking a full load. I was gonna, say. I. Hope God gives me the strength to swallow. My own puke when the moment comes, I mean quick reaction time on him somewhere somewhere I wish the minister had that willpower. Mmm just swallow it down. You know she stole the show that was a more appropriate time to smoke. I wish had more puking video, that's all of God.

Here's the whole here's my whole issue and I think it's [ __ ] up that he literally had just passed and all the people on the internet on Twitter and [ __ ], we're like here kids. This is an example: stop [, __, ], glorifying drugs and [ __ ] right, hip, hop and [ __ ]. But it's not like anybody asked to to get hooked on [, __, ] and you know be. Have you know issues within yourself that something makes you feel better and you can't help it so the student just [ __ ], died and everybody takes it as a as a prime opportunity to to shame people who may have issues with drugs well, instead of supporting them like saying it's gonna be alright, like we'll figure this out, mmm and I. Think that's what the fucked-up part is. That's a really good point. That's what we always talk about addiction as well. Is that like it doesn't just take a drug right and you can try a drug and you'll, be fine! You don't get addicted immediately. It's you, gotta! Have really that's what like, if you, if you, this is extreme example, but if you shoot up heroin once your life is ruined and it's like well, you don't you don't generally get addicted to drugs unless you have something underneath that your treat you're medicating yourself for right, I think that's a very it's a very wise way to think about it. I think I just think it's fun he's gonna [, __, ] change. It I mean [, __ ], but sucks he's a good guy sucks ass rip for real [ __ ]. You pour out what yeah you brought a little beer for it. Just look up for your computers in remotes in label machine in. Can you come clean up this mess? Please I'm kidding. You can leave it on the table in spirit. Alright, let's watch some more videos. Yeah, it's a it's a downer. It's hard to talk about this I think like I, only knew him for a little bit but mmm more than what like a genuine good, real true person that he was his music was was gonna change like the culture of everything like already shifting culture in such a short like period of time that you know he was. You know like kind of on I guess and but he's just an incredible talented, dude and good guy I was watching videos him on stage. He was good man like yeah, [, __, ], fantastic, you know, I said: okay, whatever I, don't wanna get too deep into it, but rip yeah, probably I'll, leave with what you said. I think that was that was very wise, because you're never gonna stop drug addiction. You give the treat you have to it's a dollar for the person yeah. It's everybody situation is different. Mm-Hm and you know say like why would you [ __ ], like he just died like a kid just died, and this is your. This is when you choose to shame people who may or may not use drugs. You know what I mean it's just it's [ __ ] people are [, __, ], I. Think people are pieces of [, __, ] I think they they mean well in it they're just like they're just stupid, they mean well, you know, because you don't you don't generally think about. Xanax is like a dangerous drug. Although I guess it is starting to me yeah, you know prescriptions. Yeah I mean there's an epidemic now: prescription drugs are [, __, ], killing people, but I, don't know if it wasn't that'd be something else. People got problems, they take it yeah you right, it's all. It's all the person I mean like people like I had I had a struggle like whenever I first came out here, and it is [ __, ] I didn't have any money, I didn't have nothing and I would just [ __ ] get weird like do crazy, [, __, ] and drink and [ __ ], two xan's and [ __, ] and I. Don't do it anymore, because I realized that it's not a good path but like if someone was there, you know instead to [ __ ], shame me, but you know be there like. As a friend you know, I just wish more people were like that. Instead of thinking like they know it all. You know what I mean. It's so easy to say. Oh you should do this. This is bad, but it's not fair for you to say that, because you don't know what someone's going through, you know what I mean for sure yeah, that's how I feel cool got any memes. Dude I got memes for days, man I'm a broker mean broker kind of memes means I got one on deck here. Have you heard of Elsa gate mmm-hmm? This kind of it like annoyed me a little bit? Okay, because I've been talking about this [ __ ] for so long how kids channels are sick, depraved garbage on YouTube? Why doesn't the Wall Street Journal write about that [, __, ] I think they know. Okay, but I've been taught I've made so many videos about this over the time, and now everyone is like yo h3. You need to make another Elsa video and it's like feel like I'm, just beating a dead horse right at this point. But now the media is starting to pick up pick up on it and people have been dating. There's like a subreddit lcj and people have been digging into some [ __ ], weird, really weird [ __ ], like it sweeter. Well, it's always been weird, but let me show you some of these like thumbnails, oh so this is a popular kids show look at this thumb up, so here's one called Elsa and Peter missunderstand eating [, __ ] and in the thumbnail, these kids are eating. [ __ ] out of the toilet, eating [ __ ], it's the name of the video. This is monetized. Yes, probably it was on the kids app bike. I imagine I mean, has 134 thousand views, Elsa's, forced slavery and club strippers and they're crying on a stripper pole, half a million views from one month ago. This one like. Let me explain how the YouTube algorithm works these videos in general, but it's specifically these kids videos and do not get like these channels either. The videos have like 500 views or millions right, and it just depends on if the algorithm picks it up and promotes it, because these kids sit on their tablets and it's just scroll auto place through videos all day. Okay, well S&amp;M one. So this one, this S&amp;M one has six point million views in two weeks: that's cool though that means most likely. It was mom ties and it definitely means it was heavily promoted by YouTube, and here is a girl with a web, a dude in a speedo being basically dominated by it like a dominatrix and a crying girl with wagga money, what the [ __ ] and then to the right of it revenge hypnosis is a. She has her on a leash and she's crawling around like it's just weird, and so it's just strange. It's stuck it's weird and it's sexual here's, one where the kids are drinking piss, that kids, peeing they're, just I, think well. Look at this they're abducting this girl. That's on the bottom left. You have Mickey Mouse, Mickey and Minnie Mouse. What there's there's a girl, gagged and taped and bound and they're abducting her eight hundred twenty thousand views and then to the right of it is spider-man with a stiletto fetish being stepped on by Elsa's stilettos. So these are all reminiscent of really dark, weird porn, fetishes they're real, what the [ __, ] and so people are theorizing that this [ __ ] is all run and somewhat of a front buff for actual pedophilia rings, we're real, a child sex rings or whatever right so there's some. It not correct. There's not really really good evidence, but there's some compelling stuff, though yeah here I'll show this [ __ ] gets really weird, but I mean these thumbnails is enough. This is weird because you, you wouldn't make these thumbnails and put it on unless you were trying weird to be sick yeah. This is an accident. You know this isn't made by a full-grown person yeah. This is a legit business, you're animating yeah, yes, they're putting a lot of resources. These are grown. These are adults making this and a big operation. So let me pull up some of those yeah. Here's a comment from one of these videos. This [ __ ] is honestly pretty disturbing here guys make the episode that she is all naked will be banned, yeah, so there so okay that that one's, not that weird, let me show you we'll be Ben Warren Rushmore back real are the ones are Russian, so this [ __ ], so somebody links a moment from the video and at that time stamp. According to this person, I haven't clicked it. The little girl is shown touching herself between the legs in the comments they linked to that moment and the guy says I'm glad someone else knows that too smiley face. She does it at two, so sweet I could help her out with that. For sure a tongue could do her so well. So these are the these are not kids watching this [ __ ]. These are [ __, ] creeps and there's there's whole genres with millions of views on YouTube of little girls. First of all, this is there's nothing wrong with a kid in a bathing suit right, but sometimes there's these channels where they're in skimpy little bathing suits and there seems like they're, making kid content real kids yeah for kids and it's like innocent enough, but then you see you're like who is actually watching this [ __, ] I'm sure some kids are. But when you see comments like this you're like what the [ __ ], we are what those are actually going on here right. What this is [ __, ], crazy, there's a lot more there's uh yeah! Here! Let me go! Let me go you, the Elsa gates, subreddit and show you the top post there. Well, let's go down the meme hole on this one. So let me sort by top of all time here: yeah, it's it's! It's super super disturbing stuff, so we looked at that one drinking beer, so this one is coded gibberish comments. So these guys, when you go to these videos, you'll see that there's just a bunch of gibberish typed out like Oh half the comas are all gibberish and the explanation you frequently hear is like it's just kids slamming the keyboard and it's just total nonsense. Comment: yeah, I, read perfect: English can't really write it. Even though I can read it and understand, like some words, I'm just gonna well comment, and then it's like two-year-old who's, just pushing buttons. That's what I can say right, and so this guy theorized that there are codes, for example. Here's an example of a common I found on one of the colors videos when type manga into a virtual tied keyboard. Emulator tie symbols appear instead of English letters and you can got a sentence and tie that is able to be translated. For example, this shows up like this that goat says I have to go to bed. Okay, that's just an example. It's crazy! So here you go down. Let's see here. There was one over here was in the comments, so here this guy did this one on this comment. It's just total gibberish right. If you remove the garbage, it says, see you soon parking lot bring her what the [ __ ], what okay! So what this guy did is he took out a bunch of the stuff, see you soon and the parking lot bring her yikes, that's crazy! So, like man, let's see there's all kinds of articles about it now and then this is fair. There's one of the posters, don't let Elsa gate become pizza, gate he's saying like let's not get carried away right because there's probably a problem here: let's not divulging the total conspiracy theory, but and then like look at this [ __ ]. This is all different channels. Thumbnails they're, all the same [ __ ] of this clip of drinking piss. So they think that there's actually one huge organization that would make sense. It's exactly the same stuff. Look at this yeah, that's Chris about twenty or thirty thumbnails here which are all derivatives of the same same format. There's a wall, one dudes peeing in it the other person is drinking on the other side, but they're technically from different channels. Yes, they're all different channels. According to this post, I mean there is a phenomenon YouTube where people always steal. Thumbnails like right, but I mean this weird look how similar it is. Yeah same wall I've seen so I'm planning I'm actually planning a video about this and I. Don't there's videos the Russian shits, the weirdest there's this phenomenon. We made a video about a while ago, where this guy had needles and he was injecting a baby doll. There's a whole weird fetish questions, the weird guy, but I mean glove Garneau with someone else, but on Russian YouTube you'll find videos with MIT, like tens of millions of views of people, role playing with the real kids and giving them real injections and they're screaming, and crying and they're strapped down and they're, injecting their bare ass, real kids, yes, real kids I. Just you know whether this shit's, true or not, I set it on Twitter. It's like our new video got D monetized immediately. It had a little side, boob on it and I blurted out I painstakingly blurred every detail out, and it was immediately demonetised they're, like d monetizing, all tv-ma content and meanwhile the [ __ ] they're, showing the kids is the most depraved [ __ ] I've ever seen, you gotta emphasize that it was do monetized after they reviewed it right. It's not yeah. Everyone thinks like well wait for them to review I uploaded it 24 hours ahead of time. It was demonetized, I requested a manual review and they Dumont yeah. They cut the montage, but new one yeah, one that we just supposed to do I'll be the judge of that yeah yeah yeah you'd, be the judge of that. Tell me what you think about that. Anyway, what the [ __, ], I'm gonna, go I'm gonna go down deeper down that rabbit hole in our upcoming video. Thank you sure. It's crazy! It's there's there. It's probably mostly just weird garbage, but there's some percentage hiding within the normal [ __ ]. That is doing some weird I, think we're gravy creepy [ __ ]. If it's one organization, that's crazy. It's gotta be I, think people are so sick. How do you [ __ ], like it's [, __, ], weird? How do you what's wrong with people? Man like I feel like more than ever I'm so disillusioned, like this whole Harvey Weinstein thing right, like this guy's straight up, raping people for decades and he's just like. Oh I'm gonna go to my job the next tomorrow and and make a movie and not even like worry about it, and every 10 minutes. There's a new one of someone else: I'm getting like fatigued I'm getting sex offender fatigue, it's crazy wearing a [ __ ] crazy place. Have you a weird stories? The things you've seen um I feel like I'm, not high level enough mm-hmm right once you get to that. Like jay-z pool party [, __ ], something like that. Jay-Z is probably good, but there's some weirdos any Patrice updates. Okay, it doesn't rotate anymore who's. How you should see if anybody can like super sleuth that look in the comments see but yeah yeah see. If do we have questions? Let's take a call, let me take a call know whose house that is okay, cool, I'm gonna take a call. We have got on the line saying that he was showing like a shower too I got I'm the lizard yeah on the stream hold on one sec. Let's touch that after we take this call from I am The Lizard King. What okay yep yo, but I? That's good wait wait. So my question is for post e okay. So what is something you wish? Someone told you before you joined the music industry, um I, don't know I wish somebody told me how much work it was gonna, be like yeah yeah. You know it's like my favorite thing you know is being in the studio and everything and that's at that point. It doesn't even feel like a job, but you know whenever you're going around doing promo and, like you know, meeting and greeting you know everybody from different companies different everything, that's the part where it gets exhaust all the other yeah and it's just I wish. Somebody told me how much interviews suck, because it's like you know they ask you the same questions over and over again I hate that yeah I mean not that experience that but I hate repeating right, yeah. You know and you try to come up with a different answer every time, but at the end of the story, yeah yeah yeah, it's like dude, just be like everybody. I just had this interview with this other guy just go. Watch that we're good yeah, exactly as I say, video yeah, just not say anything in the show video about my answers. Oh my god! That's yeah, I bet you there's so much extra [ __ ] yeah. It's a lot! What's to stop you from just being like no more press I'm, just going to see already got that really yeah after the tour I'm locked off I'm. Here you gotta focus on your craft. At some point, I have to finish my album yeah everyone's waiting for the beer, bongs mentally I'm, ready Rock coming by gonna, be done. I'm gonna finish it this week. Really. Is it gonna be out this week, no be out December? You got to do some posts on December 1st at midnight, that'd be insane viral marketing yeah. It was all me the whole time. Here's one I got Facebook is listening. Okay! First of all, let me preface this by saying one. As you all know, I despise Facebook I think they are the Antichrist an evil company they're run by sociopaths Mark Zuckerberg er is a sweater wearing [ __ ]. Robotic. Look at me doing human things right! There's that one video of him and everyone's got VR goggles on I. Think we washed it together. Maybe what pull this up before Mark but Artie, this video beer, demo yeah where's, this [ __ ], he's like oh this [ __ ] is funny. This isn't what I was looking for, but it's great okay, there's this AI news channels that just auto-generate news clips with AI voices and other B staffers pulled off on Tuesday I, don't care with the Red Cross right, so we're gonna partner up with right. Let's, okay, just explain the video anyway, it doesn't matter it's hard to explain, but this this one we're about to watch and just by the title of the video I, already know that it's real because it just happened like what happened you so I ordered I ordered this thing is listening to us all, the time yeah but I a bunch of stuff from 511, and they make like tactical clothes. The great brand very cool stuff and I was talking about it, like oh I'm, so excited to get my five eleven stuff around Ben. Who is my assistant and it's like next day he gets an advertisement for 511. I mean I'm, trying to do it with four-wheelers I want to buy a four-wheel right. So this is exactly what this guy's showing and his finish it and Facebook is so [ __ ] creepy, like they know no boundaries like as a company I, think they're artistic I know they're the people who run an artistic artistic and they don't understand like what's not right, like just having your phone to listen to people without telling them, so you can honor them and she's not rightly so. Now don't understand that watch this [ __ ] by the way take this with a grain of salt, because there there's no definitive proof in this video. But it is compelling definitely happens to me. Is my wife. It's not surprising for sure. So here have a look and we think Facebook is listening to us and taking key words from our conversations and then putting in suggested ads through Facebook, pulling funny like when I do a test here, nice camera and oh yeah, nice, nice I, be the ugly [ __ ] cat, my favorite genre of oblivion cats. We never search for cats, especially cat food, let's find out alright. So all day we are going to be talking about cat food because I could use some cat food. Well, the cat is almost out of food, so we might need some cat food. We should buy some captain I went to into it the wife, roleplay you're, having a lot of fun and ask if they know where to get cat food and there you have it cat food, it's not the most scientific. Well, they got to do another by the way this came in two days later. So that's what I found interesting two days later. Oh no, it doesn't happen immediately. Cuz. It's too obvious that the same thing happened to me. I can't remember what it was, but there was a certain item that we were like talking about and then I got an ad for it and I never typed it in yep I. Never looked it up, I think it's the Alexa. Does that - they call the Alexa the Amazon. Did you get rid of it yeah? You know it's only kitchen counter, but I'm pretty sure that [ __ ] eavesdrops on yes. Well, how would she know if you say Alexa right, she's got to have a constant stream of listening, what they don't tell you that they send that data back to their servers. Gotta be I mean you know like we're just hanging out in the living room and in the other, completely other room, and then she just goes I'm. Sorry, I didn't get that really yeah. That's happened several times. I keep around, though very convenient one time it was really creepy. We were just having a random conversation, never said anything that sounded like like so and then all of a sudden she was like I'm. Sorry I didn't understand that she's, not I'm. Sorry I wasn't talking to you. Sorry she never apologized. So anyway, I hate, Facebook, they're, they're, just evil. They're awful I want to erase facebook straight up I'm. So over it here's one of the founding members of Facebook. What did he do exactly this guy I think it started. You think they had plans for it. Do we like this or do you think it was well that's to just be like this video addresses exactly that question really: okay, this guy Sean Parker, who was the former president of Facebook and he quit with a guilty conscience. This guy ran Facebook, listen to him, talk about it! You know, if the, if the thought process that went into building these applications, Facebook being the first of them to really understand it. That thought process was all about. How do we consume as much of your time and conscious attention as possible? And that means that we need to sort of give you a little dopamine hit every once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a photo we're a post or whatever, and that's going to get you to contribute more content and that's gonna get you. You know more likes and comments. It's a it's a valid! It's a social validation feedback loop that that it's like I mean it's exactly the kind of thing that a that a hacker like myself would come up with, because you're like that, it's a self-proclaimed anchor a hacker like myself did I have best faith that dude hacks. You have carbo-loading a vulnerability in in human psychology and I, just I think they just you know we, the inventors creators, you know- and it's it's me it's mark. It's the you know Kevin Systrom and Instagram. It's all of these people understood this consciously and we did it anyway. So a one had the guy, so bastard Batory and a acknowledgment of that you're right. You know the founders me these other guys were brilliant and we understood that and we saw it. I mean on one hand my reaction is like obviously, but on the other hand, what is he implying he's saying that the Facebook feed is intentionally built to manipulate people's mood right? So, if nobody's liked your [ __ ] in a day they're like I, want this person stayed hooked, so they'll show your post. This is what I'm, guessing from what he said: they'll keep showing your post to people that they know you care about, always at the top of your feet until it you get that, like that dopamine that keeps you coming back right. So it's not like a democratic process: they're they're, [, __, ], they're, intentionally [ __ ] with people, they're kind of creepy I think it is creepy. You think that when you would scroll down your feet, it's like just chronological what people posted and way it used to be it's just. It really did that's why I actually liked Facebook back in the day it was chronological and you felt like you were current. You understood what was happening, but now it's just a nightmare. Facebook yeah, it's yeah! It's like to get! You know people hooked like he said like you want. You want to be validated. He said you know by your peers right so like. If you think something is cool and you post it and then you get a like you're like oh okay, cool God, we're friends. He said later or I saw I read in a news report. People spend on average 50 minutes a day on Facebook Facebook users and then nuts, that's a lot more really yeah right on average I guess I, don't know pressure even I probably spend 10 minutes a day and I don't [. __ ] with my girlfriend, spends a long time not on Facebook, but on Twitter Instagram, a long time I like Twitter Instagram I like Twitter a lot I love both of them for different reasons, but twitter twitter there's nothing there, there's no [ __ ], it's just it is chronological. As far as I can tell right. It's just people talking yeah people being people. People have been people great memes, it's just it's not transparent like gone, illogical, yeah, it's, but what what's really popular? It's not so up to them. I hate that I know, I. Think someone doesn't like you guys at YouTube I mean we've long suspected that I think a lot of people. There do like us, I think the upper upper management there hates us because they see us as anti social justice, warrior reactionists. They see us as dangerous, not I. Don't think there's so much concern about us being a threat to the platform, because we talk about it. I think it's a political thing, I think I honestly think it's an ideological. How are you threat to the platform? It doesn't make any [ __ ] sense, because we always talk [, __ ] about YouTube and poke holes, then I'm gonna watch. What can you do? Anyways I smoking cigarettes is bad for you, people so I'm, saying I. Don't think that that's what threatens them? It's the ideology of us making fun of like social justice warriors which they need. It's weird I did but I genuinely think. That's what it is that that they hate about us. Do you agree? You know it's a shame, because I'm, a very liberal leftist person and and I feel like on the left, is a little political. You don't have to get involved, but the left is like and realizing itself and it's sick. Like the super. Far left radicals they cannibalizing their own political allies. You know just because I don't think some entitled [ __ ] xarna should be able to harass humungus right, no I started noticing her channel [ __ ] with after that whole humongous thing we made a couple of like anti social justice worries. We didn't that's when I noticed it our channel getting [ __ ] right, hmm anyway. Let's what see this you're gonna love, you're gonna! You are gonna, absolutely lose your [ __ ] at this video, this one's called reek, reclaiming the armrest and this guy's a total legend right now. Let me start from the beginning, because it is an important sentence here. What up Facebook's? You know we're in some [ __ ] [ __ ] now buy a good stuff, get ready. What's up, Facebook's bathroom right now in an airplane and I have a guy sitting. Next to me that thinks he owns the armrest I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna try to get some video of me showing that if he wants that tussle with the muscle, hopefully I get it on camera. This guy's about the tussle with the muscle boy bump mom. This is these. This is Facebook names. He does CrossFit too by the way why'd. He do it so aggressively hold on. Is he strong kind of make up facebook video I mean, does CrossFit exactly [Music], we just testable with the muscle buddy you just tested with the muscle my dog, that's crazy. He did I mean that's kind of the reaction that I would have yeah. It's not anything to fight over like nothing, really yeah what the wall I mean when you tussle with the muscle yeah you're gonna, get it yeah yeah. That's a good, fantastic, really um! Here this one. What up Facebook's I need all my videos with that now: okay, I love! How Facebook is now like an individual like there's a bunch of love y'all out there, oh you're, looking at my facebook, I love Facebook's follow that guy. He seems like a laser. In the real legend, he seems like a cool dad right, yeah, very cool, dad, I love cool, dad memes, any news. It's for the camera me there. You guys I was working through that my head I was talking this this next video goes out to everybody who hates their job. Okay, because as much as you hate your job, it could be worse. Just remember that and that I feel bad for whoever's job. This is because a parent record, it's what I just said. This is as bad as it gets. Okay, no, oh my god! That's not full screen! I want to go now. This video doesn't go anywhere. This is it imagine it's Monday! 8:30 a.m. you drag your ass out. You got a cup of coffee you're, getting paid minimum wage, probably maybe a little bit over just pumps it through the soul crush, and you have to confront these up. Heat-Seeking [, __, ] and then they say. Steel looks like a case of the Mondays whole office. Fish joke like this. There's workplaces like this I would probably uh I. Think I'm good. So, no matter who you are wherever you work, it could be worse. I cannot. Thank you to me. That's how I just don't think songs belong in the workplace, maybe later maybe later in the evening. Right and you know that's Monday I could just I know that's Monday morning. God that's what I was thinking. Let me pull that up. Let me pull up that Walmart chant this shit's gonna [ __ ], your life up, Austin, no matter how, however sick of the [ __ ], you are in your life. Just imagine it's Monday morning, 8:00 a.m. you're in Walmart and your boss. Does this making 650 an hour? And he says you have that? Well, you have to participate and stomp your feet. Austin or your fire hang up reminds me a minute like race. Would he call that not seen before the minutes? Rage start freaking out I, just read it's a great book. [Music] little flies great book. It's like one of those like that. You would never plan on reading it, but it's it. They make you read for a reason. Yeah, it's a good thing like I would never read those books but I. Looking back I'm like I was enriched my soul. I. Never read that one read that I had no there's like a scene where you get some prostitute, just talks to isn't there some meme about like people there's been serial killers, two separate ones that were found with Catcher in the Rye in their back pocket. Really. Can you research that he entered an do some research on serial killers and catch her in the right? Anyway, sorry I was having so much wrong. It just goes on set this here. Alarm clock every morning make this your alarm so that you know your life could be worse. That's my life advice. You know what I really hate is. It was the most cringe eesh is whenever my teachers saying and it's just like acapella yeah, like my teachers, would sing like cute little song and I'd be like this is really I'm. Cringing, don't sing right, just just don't yeah time and place for song like I, don't know it! There's like they're, expecting if we're gonna be like wow they're, pretty good I, like you know, you're proving yourself to me pretty cool, so the guy who murdered John Lennon had Catcher in the Rye on really in there is there more than one case of what sir there was more than one wasn't there Dan yeah the guy who shot or tried to kill Reagan also was apprehended with the book on him and then allegedly Harvey Oswald according to Wikipedia, but really that's the read to presidential assassin, tip attempts and John Bull once successful and then John Lennon who's like even beyond presidential right. That's three catches in the right. I. Don't want to read that person's yes, huh! Well, I'm, fine! Well, certainly you're, not the what I did right. I, definitely wasn't paying attention. That's where you yeah! It's that it's that CIA brain-scrambling you read Catcher in the Rye, then all the sudden they're, like dog, poops and a bench and then you're like, must kill the president yeah I know I mean it's not an interesting book.

You think. If they're gonna like do some mind, scrambling tricks in a book, they would do it in like Harry Potter or something right, yeah yeah. They wouldn't pick an obscure who wrote that book. Oh Dan was saying the guy. Tell me more about the author, because Dan just said: the guy was really weird too Salinger. What did he do? Jerk off in a theater or something?

He has like dozens and dozens of other novels that he wrote and thought they were all crap and refused to release them and yeah he's just he died recently, like in the last 10 years or so, and and yeah just died like completely isolated living in the middle of nowhere in this house. The gated house would never talk to anybody. Just weird guy okay I mean that's weird: how about weird? What's the gross? What how much did that book make and when was it released?

They have like very it's very like aggressive way to say it yeah. It's like I want to kill every Jew on this planet. They say like they're, probably saying I wanted. So every close. No, definitely no. They said so like I would say like singer, singer singer, but the Germans go sigdoc right, yeah, see that's exactly what I'm saying they're like man, I wish I could so human flesh. This can of Jews. Please say Singha from now on! No heart are you down here. It's inappropriate. People are very sensitive these days, not doing anything right, I thought you're doing hi cutie I do can I, don't know that I'm, a hi, cutie I, don't know if I can get away with that. It's just me.

So this is what I call a tough crowd. So yeah, let's break this down in this episode of ridiculousness [Music]. Oh good battery change will be the living [ __ ], like he's dealing with the hecklers in the car Midway arise with just a good fun. The guys on the stage has got a guitar to the bus station slap, the dick out of your mouth when you're working do since then II waited cause he's a male prostitute, also also also shredding, while, while he's talking shredding and does a little riffs a lot now, here's when, when the crowd gets ready here, you go have a good time. Everyone, a good time, [Music] [, __, ] axes, the sky. With this guitar over that you saw him he's coming at me folks. What do you think absolutely not no kidding show's over dumb out? It's a tough crowd. It's nice cause I'm. Next, it's called so how to deal with hecklers. Why don't one? What in the strike? You're good? It's all fun and games? It's great, how quick it goes from everyone's. Like oh he's, being heckled, it's so much fun! You still with a blackberry he's got this. Look afterwards, like you could kill someone right now, yeah, it's pretty destroyed like him, though. Roxtor I'm not, but it's interesting like once the attack happened. You realized that the anger wasn't a joke, like everyone thought that frame very quick, very quickly based a lot of velocity. There I mean essentially like hitting somebody with a guitar. Doesn't really hurt, I mean that's it's maybe an electric, but not an acoustic I mean because acoustic is kind of like thinner. It's follow an electrical I killed that one yeah, that's a good point. If he an electric, he would have yeah I. Maybe he wouldn't have, though, maybe maybe that guy was a plant just to get on the podcast. This is a long bomb. Yes, Patrice Allah, Patrice, Wilson level of planning. Have we got a callin from taillow halo way, Oh? What up don't play me like that? You better say some [, __ ] I can't hear you girl. Oh, this is happening what's good, okay, so obviously my question is proposed. Anyways. My question is posed last time. You're on the podcast, you mentioned the construction of a doomsday bunker. Yeah I'm just wondering. Have there been any developments as construction been completed? Have you picked spot yeah? Thank you, I'm working on I'm working on a nice fortified area out of state somewhere. You know, you know middle of middle of America I, like that. Your accent changed when you started talking about it. Yeah a little like country, twenty two boys middle American, middle America, no um, yeah, we're working out we're working on it right now. I just bought a house out there and then we're gonna start building immediately. Do you think you're invited that's nice? Do you think we're getting closer or you think I like the climate? Are we more likely doomsday? Are we getting further from doomsday I? Think I wouldn't say doomsday I would say government. What is that beer, you're afraid of like a hot, like a like a thought off my own little tips here, tired tyranny, listen yeah, yeah, yeah, I, think I! Think under our current administration, I don't know. Just generally, you don't generally generally just a feeling of like even [ __ ] Facebook right. It's the way that the mission is listening to us all the time. It's way: creepy yeah, it's just weird! Well, what's my new facebook, facebook, facebook, bots and we've watched the news, I, don't think Facebook would do it I think I think they're part of it I mean all that data gathering I mean [ __ ], if they'll listen to our conversations and shove ads down our throats based off of what we talked about. That date is definitely being [. __ ] transferred [, __, ] and people are listening to everything that we say and everything's on record and I. Think that's [ __ ] 1984, that's creepy! It is so creepy man and a lot I mean a lot of people will tell you well I didn't do anything wrong, so I have nothing to worry about right, but that's a fallacy, because if, essentially, if you you know, one wants to live in a [, __, ] dictatorship or a tyrannical right zeitgeist. Well, anytime, if you become someone of importance, that's a threat to whatever establishment- or maybe you have someone in in power that be that thinks of you as an enemy or wants to extort you or blackmail you anything you say are done, could be used against you in any way. Just keep my mouth shut. It's also creepy. You do handle my own and take care of my friends. You know stock up yeah, just you know, four or five be safe, be safe from take make sure that I can do what I can to make sure that I'm, safe and my friends and family are safe. That's nice, but am I still. What was my position in your government me sure I thought yeah. It was like it was like you got to write down everything that happened in the old world. I'm the new world scribe describe yeah, that's nice! That data is gonna, be very messy all right. The records from that leave tow very shaky. Not a lot is known. [Laughter] I think you do a good job. Thanks preciate you a kneeler, makes ecology, but that's not the culture like who is this guy, like a thousand tracks, there's apparently an a Patrice update is changed patterns really here's what I think's going on there I think he's actually there, and these are live updates that he keeps looping, and so he knows we're talking about him. So he keeps he said: they're [, __ ], with the curtain in a heartbeat pattern, so I think he's just trying to bait us a little bit. This video tickled me patient, patient cop gives drunk man every chance to go away this time. What is your address? This is like how dare you thank you tell me that I'm not angry. This is a just trying to get deeply right now. This is like a scene out of like some like post-apocalyptic world wrong time to be an activist dude over me.

This guy was um this guy. He definitely deserved to be arrested. He deserved to be arrested a long time. Yes, yeah. How [ __ ] patient was that cop crazy? Well, that's all I got there's a meme meme hole. Yeah, we went all the way down. I mean there's a couple things that skip through, but [ __ ]. Then I got one more. You want more yeah one last way Road. You know Joel Osteen, remember that guy yeah, you know him from the church. He was the guy for the mega church and Houston was flooded boy yeah and he's like. Oh my god, I don't want these poor people's [ __ ] dirty shoes. Am I right mega church yeah? So there was this guy. This was on reddit, it's a great video.
