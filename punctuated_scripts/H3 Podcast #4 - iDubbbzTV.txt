My first question for you, mmm is a do you remember, there's this one youtuber he's really big. Do you remember leafyishere uh! Is that the guy who looks like a lesbian? No, no, that's a different one. This guy looks like a [ __ ] ooh, now I'm good now, I feel like I'm going in now he's like a little he's, got like a little chin. I guess is what he's known for the lesbians, the other guy, oh yeah and I haven't heard of him I, don't remember and I. Remember him vaguely. This feels me yeah. This feels this feeling I thought planned for this to be funnier. Let's just wrap it up holiday. You know just wrap it. So Ian is known for, like you've known for your very kind of inflammatory, like you, you you're, not you're, very anti PC I would describe you as we're on YouTube is a space. That's very it's very caters to like disney-esque cater. Yes, they love them and in a time, we're being pcs, it's so hard to be unplugged. His [ __, ], [, __, ] and I'm, not gonna, get in trouble because I'm just quoting him but like how do you break that down? For me like well, okay, well, just for also he's gay yeah. Also yeah he's so yeah he's gay, okay, so [ __, ], [, __ ]. Isn't the slogan? Oh, the slogan is hey. That's pretty good yeah come on [ __, ], [, __, ], that's a character! You've just got so many catchphrases yeah this guy's I I, don't make him myself I. Just you know: I can get away with it. Cuz. Someone else said it right right. So well, who said: [, __, ], [, __, ] uh, an unfortunate gentleman who, whose Kickstarter I made fun of oh I, didn't know that. Yes, so it's almost like you're, not even the race. This you're, just like this guy, happened to say and I'm just living his memory right exactly. What was the Kickstarter I didn't catch that? Well, it was. It was basically a game console mm-hmm. This young man was making a game console right that had eight, he had the schematics up there and everything, but the schematics were drawn in ms paint, okay and it just it didn't look quite right. So right, I decided to talk about it and next thing I know he's making a vlog directed toward me and he opens it up with something like you: [ __, ], [, __, ], [, __, ], [, __ ], oh yeah, that's a wonderful backstory, because I feel, like you, get a lot of heat for the saying that right, but it's actually a wonderful little callback, yeah, believe it or not. I'm, not I'm you're, not not that racist. Okay, a little bit, though sulfa merely just a little racist haha. But let's say on it a little bit. How did he come up with that? I wonderfully kindly view watch the derek comedy sketch mmm, if you guys are familiar with that, so it didn't even start from him. No I, don't think so. My [ __ ] [ __ ] just been around the block. Yeah yeah [ __ ] [, __, ], [, __ ]. It's a wonderful! It's just a wonderful string of words that really get you going yeah like soliloquy, it's a feel-good! It's it's like mouth silk, mm-hmm yeah, but the the I'm gay thing I mean that I'm proud of that yeah. So definitely proud of that. Well, so ian has this thing: was it a collaboration with? Is it a filthy Frank or was it a maximal foe that would be max mofo? So he goes so Ian jumps into the frame in a Batman esque fashion, and he just says: I'm gay how'd I do I'm gay. That's been a bit effeminate yeah I needed sorry I. Wasn't there my confidence levels, yeah yeah Ted, to proclaim that yeah so that the little meme is now what you're, not you're, I'm gay guy yeah I, don't mind that it's fun yeah! It's funny, I! Really like it! It's it's cool -! Are you gay? No hmm I have a lovely girlfriend who's in the room right now. Hmm, let's see gay I mean you would know better than anybody he's a little gate. Alright, oh yes, Mac yeah! That's it and I've had relationships like that. Almost where you're like I'm, not gay but I, have a friend who I [, __ ] yeah right. That's what you're saying when did you have I think it came out? Weird, no, that's kind of but like what that you know them. No, never mind sounds bad I'm, not first Wapner [, __ ], the guy. It just came out wrong, but I was saying sale like sometimes you're, like you have that male friend you're, like a little too close with, and people like, oh they're, gay, that's anyone max yeah, definitely except we're close yeah. Why it's actually saying I'm more gay with my friend from high school Raj he's a good guy! God bless. You shut up, -, Raj, Big Ups. To read your read! You gay ass, [, __ ], you love! It didn't get any one like that like well. Why no gay? What do you guys do together? Yeah we're not gay stuff. What are you gay gay? What are you gay he'll it so you're I mean is you're kind of your style is very anti PC. Is that by intention- or you just express yourself, it is by intention I, really don't like being limited. I'm a big fan of freedom of speech, First Amendment, it's number one! Yeah, it's it's number one right up there of a second amendment yeah, oh my god. How do you have a gun on you he's nodding? Yes, but he won't say yes, no I would never bring a firearm to a pond on Ian's, [, __, ] pact and he's scared. My gun I'll shoot you no he's going back into character. Why you just turn away yeah? What is that character? It's kind of like I like to think of it as a cholo, but, like oh I, didn't catch that yeah. It's it's sort of bad! It's a bad car! So it's like it's inaccurate, interesting! Have you did have you debuted that character yet uh in private? It's something you're working on yeah, okay and, admittedly I'm pretty sure I. Do it from ranch the guy we mentioned earlier. Oh gosh, I'll, [, __, ], that guy he's gay. It's good to be a joke thief, however, only be a joke thief to people who aren't in the industry, because no one's gonna complain. Hey! That's wonderful! Help me get like the funniest friends ever Ronnie's friends who are great comedian and their local stand-up, their waiters. Don't ever bring them in. Just have them come in, be funny and be like see you guys next week, and then you have all this material take and no one ever complain. It's brilliant I love. It yeah. You know, Craigslist get friends if you can put a post on Craigslist just but get friends, but friends, I know what that'd be helpful to me, she's working on it now. Thank you appreciate that all the guys podcast she's got the beanie on. She looks like she's gonna shoot someone. No, you don't [ __ ] gangsters, [ __, ] dude. She scares me. We were talking about that. What last episode with Bert Kreischer mm-hmm- and he was talking about how he's his wife is really like. A strong, bold, beautiful woman, kind of character and I was just saying, like yeah ela scares the [ __ ] out of me, because we were talking about like how we're both [ __ ], like in a fight I feel like I, can maybe be it up. 20% of all men, mm-hmm and then the 80% would just [ __ ] kick my ass. Like kill me right and I'm, not talking like Street Fighter I'm talking like World War, 2, Saving, Private, Ryan one-to-one deathmatch right, you know, I mean it still feels kind of good to say, like I can beat the [ __ ] out of 20% of guys. Well, the thing yeah well, including doesn't sound that good, no yeah includes everybody yeah and there's some people in wheelchairs who will [ __ ] me up, probably, but my what we were talking about was like. Even though I'm a weak-ass man I will compete the Shephelah no problem, but but she would psychologically destroy me. You know you guys can put that to the test. Probably be pretty good. Video actually go just a straight-up bloodbath. Well, it keeps coming up. So it's like at this point. We just need to throw down. You go yo, you better [, __, ] down I'm again to this cholo character. Yo! You look. No look at me sounds like this Holmes yo you throw some dogs and no no dog. This guy doesn't say dog, so you need like this. Is you [ __ ], for you, [ __ ]? You need white, so laugh at me, white socks yeah and bring him up. My kneecaps I actually do that I. Don't know why cuz you're a troll. You really used to make fun of me a lot cuz I wear like big white, dad socks and you know like pull it up all the way. You're, sometimes not aware of that sort of stuff. I recall when I was younger in my youth, I'd wear the sort of the button-up t-shirts but I button it up all the way to the top. Oh that's chill that was hell, yeah and I didn't realize. I was just like I, don't like showing my neck skin. Yes, I feel okay yeah, so I buttoned it all the way to the top, and my friends were like I think they do gang banging yeah. Exactly and I was like no I I, just I'm. Just I'm shy, that's funny, so in Israel Ethan would wear his socks like that, and no one does that in Israel. Mm-Hmm look I'm! Just being me, I used to get made fun of a lot because, where I gave it I'll just have you know, I've helped that those quiet on set sorry um when I was a kid you know, I would rock the hi dad socks, they're, comfortable, they're, cozy, thurr white, they roll them up and it's great and then all the sudden when I go to Israel people are [. __ ] goofing on me, like I, was in the elevator with my boss. One time and it goes nice socks, [, __ ]. He said that to me. Well, don't John said that to me in a nicer way, he didn't call me a [, __ ], but he's like he made me feel bad. He whittled me as a person for myself for my taste in fashion. You could use an upgrade in a lot of ways now I'm yeah, think about that yeah whole thing. Well, you [, __, ], wear sweat pants. Every night I can get away with it. I'm young I'm a you're not that young I'm a young how I can wear dirt for YouTube you're, always [, __ ], your oldest me dude! That's why I like you yeah! That's that you can relate yeah I'm, your more really because everyone YouTube so young, I'm, 31, you're, 27, right 37. How old are you I'm, 26, yeah, I thought you're, older I, don't know if this is gonna work come on quiz me dude. Ask me about old, [ __ ], Golden Girls, you like old girls, I love, gold girl was the name of Tommy. You know I, guess I'm too old. What was the last name of Tommy from the Rugrats pickles yeah? Everybody knows that yeah, that's 90, kids! Only but like so when you going back to the PC thing. Mm-Hmm you just boot, I mean like it's. You just I, just really like I, always inv comics, who are able to get away with saying [, __ ]. Anything! Yes, because, like I, don't really care about I, just think it's! It's kind of it's in a way, it's kind of a scale. It's like to be able to frame your [ __ ], so what I wrote wha yeah and it's I feel like it's more interesting, so I always just wanted to be able to do it so kind of early on when I saw the opportunity to say something, I'd be like alright. If I happen to get bigger at some point, I can always point back and say this isn't offensive. What I did then was a fence. That's fun! So get off my ass sort of thing. So you said the expectations that like right exactly. He already said that so yeah. This is not so so. If President Obama tweets at you and he's like yay light up your [ __ ] offensive mm-hm, and then what do you point to him? You're, like yo Obama, chill out look at this from my earlier career I mean obviously the [ __ ] peck, but that wasn't even that long ago. No, it wasn't. Oh I mean. Has my career been that yes yeah by the way? When did you start YouTube, okay, so I started, YouTube I would say: I ran about five years ago. Same time to us, ideally, my initial thought was hey, I might be a gamer I can play games and earn money, that's cool which is so funny because you're like the gamer pro sona, is one that's so played out on YouTube and you're such a like counterculture person. The thinking back to you, then, is it seems so different than who you are now. I was playing Minecraft. When I was 20 years old Dan, you know I, it's it's embrace really embarrassing to look back and say Jesus not long ago. I was one who's one of these well to be fair, I, don't think many of youtubers gonna look five years back and be like that's I'm, not yours right now. It's true I think it's part of the experience, yeah yeah. So it's I, don't know it's kind of cool to see how quickly you can evolve and how things can change. In a matter of a year, yeah yeah I'm over both pretty good examples of that yeah on YouTube. It's a week feels like a month. Here's like yeah, so you went from playing Minecraft and then what was the next evolution? Indie games I mean in general, I played a lot of indie games. That sort of where I, like kind of found, a niche, hmm I, get a lot of a lot of people. Razz me about that playing games like overgrowth, which is like I. Remember that yeah it's it's a really cool game. They haven't gone anywhere with it just because productions meg is slow on an indie game, especially when you hire like two people to work on it. Mmm um five shots fired at an overgrowth yeah, exactly shots fired it really all indie titles yeah games suck. So once you were what what was the transition from gaming to the next thing you da okay, so I I did sort of a brief news. Show sort of thing: I want to show my face in front of the camera, so I called the gaming news. Crap and I would just talk about like the game games that are scheduled to come out or any random thing like that. Oh yeah, those are privatised, I believe those all do you release that vibe eventually are the minecraft one? Still it I don't believe they are now yet well. You know that was on a separate channel. Even cuz I had that channel monetization disabled, so I removed past that, at this point, [ __ ], heed of I news, gaming updates, I think people will kill for that. They would actually yeah when the channel starts. Plummeting I'll slowly release so it'll, be like roots yeah. Oh, that's, crazy! He's a natural at this thing! Yeah so I did that and then I ended up having a segment at the end of this gaming news, crap thing called Kickstarter crap, oh and I would look at a random Kickstarter project, be like man. This is pretty shitty mm-hm. Most of them are gaming, focus still, though right so then, eventually I started just doing. Kickstarter crap on its own did a bunch of those videos I straight away from gaming. That's when max sort of like kind of he left a comment on one of my videos, and that is max mofo max mofo, yes and I did I had no idea who he was one of my friends just mentioned, like all this dudes verified. He he's right, writing your comments and then I was sort of trying to be the cool guy when he tweeted me on Twitter I would like respond like cool yeah, yeah dude, one-word replies and stuff like, but you know he had millions of subs. So I was like yeah, it was a big deal. It was a big deal, yeah um, but like a year, went by after that, and then we started talking more and then kind of the rest. Is history I'd say so that they can't start a crap? Actually looking back a lot of those have a lot of views now, since your channel exploded. That series was so perfectly timed because when you first started doing that, Kickstarter was just such a [ __ ], [, __ ] show yeah. There were so many people trying to grab money with the most like asinine, dumb, [, __, ] and I. Think the timing of that of that series was wonderful. It worked out well yeah. There were a lot of other people were kind of doing a similar thing, red soup ray and a few others I think they they did. The same thing but I, don't know it was all it was sort of up for grabs at that time. Yeah. It was sort of a weird niche, not too many people work. Well, it's like doing it's like a gold mine yeah, because it's like you're always looking for that wonderful, perfect YouTube video to like talk about that's like so ripe for satire all right. Well, we did together about the curing my colorblindness mhm, but you go on Kickstarter back then it's like all click goldmine, yeah, I, guess it's kind of like when we started doing reaction tests right. It's a similar yeah, it's a very similar thing and you guys and and I I think both feel the same way about there's a lot of stuff to look at and there's a lot of suggestions that fans put out there and you really have to weed them out. Cuz I recall getting a lot of suggestions that were like look at this Kickstarter project and I would look at it. I'd be like well. This is clearly just a child. Yeah can't do anything can't operate a webpage, so, like I mean I, don't know what you're expecting yeah. You want me to just go off on a tangent, well like on a child out, well that one of my favorite emails that we get all the time yeah it's like hey I've, got a perfect reaction, video for you and then you click the link and it's got like two views and it's like some [ __ ] eight-year-old. They go to high school. What do they just want to eat? Yeah um, somehow in their mind, they're like Ethan's, gonna seasons, gonna [, __ ] make a bit a whole video about this guy and slam him I was thinking that it might be fun at one just do it do it just to surprise everybody yeah, but this one kid is just no, but he's just like what the [ __ ]. What is this? That's actually yeah it could yeah I feel like it could end up being a positive thing if you frame it in the right way. So I got this email, yeah start with the email. What, if well, you could actually flip it on the guy who sent the knee they'd, be like there's a lot of them. A lot of them are very they're. They'll they'll sign off on their email, X blue dragon, 49 yeah yeah check out my channel. My channel is much better than this case. Ya know: y'all [, __ ] hurry here, y'all better back off. I Deeb's yeah he's coming hard. All you [ __ ] haters. That's actually a brilliant idea! That's a wonderful story! If you found someone really worthy of getting blasted, you yeah I mean I, don't want to give out too many good ideas, but yeah you can send out a maybe a message on Twitter: hey! You guys want anyone wants someone for me to roast anyone at your high school email. Me email me: that's a [, __, ], breath or team in at roast video, just calling you to Brad special. Finally, something good on YouTube red [, __, ], YouTube, red I I. Have such a double relationship with YouTube I feel like I've spent. So much of my career bitching about YouTube that I, almost like yeah I'm out of breath, dude I'm at rest, I, like lost I, feel like I just been beat down. You know: I've been shamed I'm naked in a dungeon they're like passing me, bread under the door I'm just like I can't just just take me just [ __ ] me in the ass I love, you I, can't say: I feel the same. I don't know I feel like you. Don't guess you too! It's like that famous Mike Tyson line where he goes. He was talking to a guy pre-fight and he goes is one my favorite lines ever I. Think I. Remember this meet I'll [ __ ], you -! You love me [, __, ] yeah! It's like saw that I love. That domination play that's a good line for your character by the way, but then the well. You want to test this. Oh [ __, ], yo, [, __, ], [, __ ], you -, you love him! [ __ ], this there's so much in that sentence. Yeah cuz, like he's [, __, ], a guy, it's passion, but somehow he's not gay he's. Turning the other guy gay cuz. He [ __, ] him so good, I love it so I feel like YouTube's, [, __ ] me til, I loved them. Thank you, I! Don't know! If that made sense, ya know that makes sense to me. Yeah. So I'm just I've been beating this submission I'm their [ __, ], yeah, I love you too yeah YouTube's, alright, we're gonna, take a quick break. Guys stay tuned is gonna, get juicy.

Every time, it's interesting how quickly it changes mm-hmm right now, one of the things that really grinds my gears are these channels that have a very specific I mean you can almost identify them via their thumbnails $332 water versus $1 fear. That's the BuzzFeed yeah that sort of stuff. It's crazy! It's it's frustrating! What do you hate about it? You there's there's almost nothing to the video, a lot of the the personalities that are in the videos. They don't actually have much of a personality. They are just there to I. Don't know it's eye, candy! A lot of the time you know the most sour drink in the world. It's like it's very interesting of a video, yes I'm calling out well yeah. That was a great shade of yellow. There will be no I mean I, think he's a great personality. You know what that's a good example. I think he's a good personality. There are other people who um who they're sort of substituting building their personality with just more [ __ ] they're, just gonna, buy more [ __ ] make the biggest gummy thing you can imagine fill fill my bathtub with tampons fill my bedroom with I guess when you say that it's kind of it's a cat extracts almost yeah but like techrax like I, the guy's sweet I like the guy, but he has the pit. He has the person yet I think I just had an aneurysm. He has the personality of a like a paper towel yeah and he's like guys. I just filled up this pool of coke. It's crazy I'm gonna fly a drone in it. Okay I flew the drone in it. Wasn't that crazy, thanks for watching thanks for watching and there's like 50 million views well, yeah actually sounded like it was mine, not good I feel like I kind of zone yeah. Thank you. Thank you. No I like thank you. You get that the best part or the the easiest way to impersonate someone or doing an impression is you just have like a very specific phrase and you don't bring it any further. What's up guys tech Rex, if I see I want more yeah, you have to watch the extended version. What guys Tex Rex here and the Brega a he's got like you have to lower your IQ like by 50 points, and then you sound like that grace yeah, what's up guys but like and then I have to say to wolfies credit. No, when I made a video goofing on him a little bit about the like begging, and he immediately dam me and was like yo I love your video. It was only a matter of time before someone called me out, god bless you and I was like that's a closet. I watched a lot of his videos and I. It was, it was very funny, like I I, made fun of the the sort of the dick sucking face and all of his thumbnails like saving it like an object line right because it makes for a good thumbnail and I always knew that, like Mac's, like filming, that is out a little bit in the slingshot one. Well, that was the purpose. Yeah was the but I want it's almost like too meta I. Think the people I think yeah I, like the face oh yeah, inside, to get the oh yeah yeah. But it's a mouth open gate. Okay, you do yeah I guarantee you'll, actually get more clicks. I'm gonna put that tag that we should do. I guarantee you well we're about to do a video together where we make fun of this knife burning sensation. If it's, if it's a stroke years or whatever happened yeah, so maybe we could do like a mouth, a gate, uh-huh double double thumb that might be a little too much yeah without our mouths and put him everywhere. But it's a get back on track the Wolfie in in one of his videos he just drilled. It every two seconds in the video he was like I would do dick sucking face like in his normal video. It was, it was hysterical and then I think PewDiePie had mentioned something about him, so he made a whole nother video about PewDiePie and the whole thing was a riot. So he takes it really. Well, he takes it. Well, that's all you can ask for yeah, which I appreciate I well, actually that cracks also did techrax took like a champ and we were even like. We even spoke about doing a collab together. Yeah he's a really nice guy yeah. Well at first he's like who the [ __ ], is this [ __ ], which is fair enough yeah and then I was like yo I. Remember how we started talking about anyway. He ended up being a real sweet guy, mm-hmm shadow I loved him, there's nothing worse than making fun of someone, and then they take it. So personally, and then they sue you, for example. That's the word. That's a bit unfortunate when that happens, that's the what happening say: yeah, it's yeah! I! Hope you don't go through it. Hopefully, the lawsuit by the way, I know everyone's waiting for updates. On that. It's that what people like, oh well, I, guess the lawsuits gone. No, it's not gone. It's still here and it's [ __, ], crazy. It's it's getting we're about to go to through deposition, now like in two days, mm-hmm, it's stressful, but um, I'm, hoping we switched attorneys so I'm, hoping for to turn into the leaf on that and hopefully wrap it up. Yeah, it's good that you're talking to people better or at least keeping people updated yeah, because I know that a lot of people who either you know we're following it or whatever you know, don't realize how long of a process a lawsuit is, and it could be much too long. Man yeah, it's not even really something that you can like give weekly updates about exactly yeah. It's soon. It's gonna be a year already I've been wanting to do an update video, but it's like there's almost nothing to say it's move so slow and now stuffs finally starting to happen, but it's out of your hands its bureaucracy, your attorneys, their attorneys branch of lawyer, [, __, ] I mean look. We yeah, we fired our previous attorneys I'll, say more about that in the future in the future, when this is all behind us, but there's been some just [ __ ], absolutely it's finished, [ __ ] show there's been a [ __ ] show all around man. It's been. It's been one of the most stressful things in our life. So what people react that way that sucks yeah back to that? Also, when people take your dams and post it to [ __ ] like Def Fame, you suck still, can we talk about that I gotta say whenever someone does that, like you're, so James, yeah you're, so dad to me and probably to a lot of people mm-hmm? Who did it recently I've seen some people do it recently, yeah race gone, oh yeah yeah when you're, just like beefing with someone you're like oh well, here's a DM where they said something nice to me: mm-hmm, it's like [, __, ], off dawg yeah, it's a little too much. I I'm guilty of showing DMS I want a show yeah, but I. There are two occasions where I've showed DMS the first one was with jinx. My screenshotted me asking him if he, if he wears a new bucket hat each day- and it was just like a question mark after it. So that's not too invasive. It's not too evasive, but inside I wouldn't have done it. It's not bad because you're not like having a conversation right. You have when you're actually having a conversation and then someone just takes it and shows it. It doesn't matter if you were even looking bad or go on text like. Why do you even do that yeah? But the bucket hat me was okay. I'll, give you a pass on that one? What was the other one? The other one was keemstar in the DMS for the that was also justified. I give you pass keemstar I tried to justify it in my head. I was like well, he shows people's DM yeah I've, seen him tweet out, DM yeah before so I said hey. If he's fine with it I'm fine with yeah, but was it in hindsight I? Wouldn't what was it he sent you? It was basically a threat with lol at the end of it. I'll ruin your career or something like that. And now that's like no I feel like. When someone threatens you to thattaboy and it came started you you, you get the warrant yeah at the time he was sort of like he had that mentality as well civil access, exactly yeah the access of you yeah. It was big yeah why YouTube has changed a lot in the past [ __ ] three months out. It goes up and down every two second well I I'm, also like I after all that [ __ ] I'm, just like over the beef I'm a weak goof on people, but like the way I handled the leafy thing was stupid. Yeah was it was bad, but obviously it was all bad, then yeah, it's weird I, don't know I sort of like try to stay out of it until it's like you got your in sir bill. That sort of like emotionally build up and then let it all out in a single video yeah and then never mention it again. It doesn't rot cast with someone. Yeah tell me all about it. So what was it like leading up to the leaf? He ran because he, the leafy rant the leafy video rant. He [, __ ] stole he ruined rant by the way. Can I just say that, like being making a rant used to be cool on YouTube and then every [ __ ] video he made was the you know, fouseytube, remember fire mmm, yeah I, really like doing seven, just the phrase rant because it it sort of exemplifies. Like a lot of what we all do on you yeah, you know a lot of times. It's just you know it's really sort of like why you guys use reaction. It's like your reaction for a video, oftentimes I'll just get in front of the camera and just say bunch of [ __, ] yeah, so yeah, it's a bit disappointing, but yeah leading up to the leafy video I was like I. Don't know. I was I, wanted to be smart about it and I. You know it was very much like the keemstar thing. It's like a lot of people didn't realize. Cuz everyone decided to jump on the bandwagon after the fact, but like leading up to it. I was very nervous because yeah obviously like it was a big deal. He had many more subscribers than me. Many people told me like this is a bad idea. [ __, ] tons of people said I, don't know. If you should do that ya know. Well, yeah I mean he made my life [ __ ] hell when I tried it well I did it so stupidly and badly. You were much smarter than me, but like um yeah, it was his must have been scary and no one had really taken like major shots at him. Since then, and like right, we got pretty [ __ ] up from that mmhmm yeah, it's the the whole thing was really bizarre. I was I was afraid like at that point, like Keim's avid supporters. Would you know mm-hmm, you know Docs me or do whatever this or that sending the SWAT team right, but so so that was the thing it's like the day before I released, the keemstar video I called my local police and I was like put me on a white list. Are you [, __, ], serious I said. Give me a call. If anything happens, I did the same thing before the leafy one as well Wow. It is that [ __ ] up seriously. Some people are really just out of their [ __ ] minds, those of you listening who don't like follow YouTube like it's that [ __ ] up yeah yeah, it's serious a lot of people, don't realize it seriously or anything work Ethan's words, that's [, __, ] up, that's [, __ ] that bag, so um yeah, you were just waiting in line. You were collecting. You were thinking about it for a long time. Yeah above all, I want to make the videos entertaining yes like and that's that's where I think. What's up I try my approach, it was rushed. It was hurried. A lot of people want to do it. I have passion for me. I'm really like I, want to get the entertainment aspect of it out there. So the leafy one was the leafy and the keemstar one I, really like there's previous ones. That I did like the finebros. If I had to take any Content comp video back, it would be the finebros one because for me, I felt like it was very much jumping on the trend of like [ __ ] on these two Jews yeah and make fun of their [ __ ] faces yeah, how much money they want yeah and how greedy they are, and that sort of [, __, ] um I mean I parody. That mentality in my video, so I felt like I separated myself, but I didn't feel like it was super reflective of their content in general, yeah and I take a pass on that, but the keemstar one in the leafy one I felt good because yeah it was fun to be creative. It was fun to do the gnome thing in the sewer. Also I mean we can tell we were we. You, like you, were in touch with us when you were collecting information about those videos. I remember and you worked on there for a while yeah. No, you were you're in there yeah it's. It is an actual project. Well, that's what made him so good and I. Remember every time you were kind of there, you're, like the mean he was there when no one else was kind of me, where you got a face in every panel like when I was hanging out with PewDiePie and jacksepticeye and markiplier and jontron in New York. When you drop the keemstar were a video uh-huh, and that was when he was at his most obnoxious like he was sitting on the Death Star and he thought he was like [ __, ] yourself poppy or even just draw up in laser bombs, calling everyone pedophiles. He was like [ __, ], rain of hair yeah and you I mean, and it was like at the perfect timing. You dropped this twenty minute, just roast yeah of this gnome popcorn eating [, __, ] right, oh yeah, and we all watch like they had already washed at their hotel room and I think we were busy all day. So we'd have a chance to like feel like no I will watch this 20 minute long, video again, we've all gathered around John's house and we were like we were watching. We were clapping. It was like watching Star Wars. It was a great night you're. Just you were look. You were the Luke Skywalker, no cuz, it's like a it feels good, because it's like such a project. You know what I mean I like the idea of having [ __ ]. You can turn out on like a daily basis, but like smell it. Slow building stuff is slow cooks, yeah yeah, some slow cooking like sets. That's soft moist meat mm-hmm, but camp star has changed so much since then. Well, that's my point to why your videos are so great is because it has impact. Yeah I swear to you that that keemstar one and the leafy one has such an impact. I mean you [, __ ], you you destroyed them. I feel like you ushered us into the new age of like the new age of peace dog year, Luke Skywalker you [, __ ] took down the the Republic guy. Goddamn yeah nobody's real right. You know I yeah. I agree I mean, and but at the same time you're also just like in it for the memes yeah x it even better you're, not there to like I just it was really fun to do that. Gnome stuff. To be honest, it was I spent so much time in my room painting up that gnome. Yes, it obviously didn't look like look that way at the start. I spent a whole night. Oh I, didn't know that eating up this gnome, that's and I was like so I had such a good time. So many pictures of this gnome after I had the G fuel logo on it. This will be the best video ever after. Just doing that, oh that's, wonderful! So! Well! You definitely that they eat. If you guys don't know he, you basically went from like 300 thousand subscribers to like now you have three million mmm and about a year yeah it about yours, I'm, crazy yeah, but I was madness. I didn't and I really didn't expect any of it. It was each video that I put out I thought was like the biggest like risk. Ever. You know I expected after the leafy one like there's, there's a good chunk of my leafy or my everyone's bouncing sort of the yeah, the subscribers that are subscribed to both of us yeah downtown. You know what I found, though, when it's when I get that feeling like this is a risky upload like that's. When you make your best videos mm-hmm, like I, remember the last time, I really felt that was the the csgo a lot of one oh yeah, when I posted that I was like [ __ ], like cuz I, knew that we're actually yeah I was like. Are we making a huge mistake doing this cuz? This is like there's actually money. This is a lot billions of dollars and actual like legal yeah. Actually, the legal ramifications actly. So when I, that was like a huge like [, __, ] yourself kind of moment, that's crazy. That was it that was I feel like you could feel proud about. A video like that, though, because it does actually have kind of an impact. I I can say that stuff they're most impactful, video mm-hmm. Well, the thing was after we that video valve shot all of them down, yep. That was like a five billion dollar industry mm-hm and it just all came crashing down, because these two [ __ ] numskulls, yeah, press syndicate, tmartn and I- haven't told this story, but this [ __ ] freaks me out right after we posted that video. We went down to Florida to meet dj khaled mm-hm and we went to Universal in Florida. This was like two days after we dropped that video and I [ __ ] [ __ ], you not. When we were leaving Universal that night I saw T Martin. He was there with his girlfriend and I saw him and he was playing Pokemon go cuz. It had just come out at the time and I was like ela, that's [, __, ], T, Martin and I did he's huge he's like a big guy, but then, but then I looked on his Twitter, like I'm at Universal. I was like 10 feet away from him, and I was like you, though we like are we gonna, because I was like I can only beat up 20%, okay and he definitely and he's not that 20% no dude, you might have a screw loose. That's what I'm worried about there's a chance that he would have been like a nice to meet you, but yeah that was fresh. That was fresh yeah. It was a wake-up that would have been an awkward encounter. I was, like you said in [, __ ] confronting not crazy. Yeah. Two days after we ran into Matt and [ __ ] Universal Studios. Hmm, that's interesting that that actually is that reminds me of VidCon. If you ever to go to go to VidCon you're gonna meet some familiar faces, I'm scared! You might want to it's a humbling experience. What do you mean uh well, meeting the finebros was a lovely experience. What was your impression on them yeah? How was their great dudes? They seem very nice, [ __ ], guys they're very enough wrong. I I don't feel bad for the video I made, but, like I, think they're nice guys and I appreciate that it's criticism and it's it's- it's did I say it's deserved, criticisms yeah well, like we made fun of the way they looked, which is kind of whatever it's fine yeah. Well, it's it feels weird because you wouldn't feel bad about. You know making fun of the way certain channels turn people on channels look but since they're, so like disconnected they're, not [, __ ] talk and yeah. They just [ __ ] up and had like I feel like their intentions, maybe weren't malicious to begin with and then the worst part that was their little like spin, video afterwards yeah. Well, that's not easy. We do I think they just have really bad PR there yeah they're, not very charismatic, and they I don't think they had a I guess. Good PR is a good way, but I think yeah. So you you ran into them. How was that yeah Rafi, not Benny Benny? Wasn't there I, don't think Rafi's going where's the beanie, all the tavini yeah? He was really nice, I, I sort of was, are you gonna, be in an episode of youtubers react anytime soon, no I'm, not uh, but I. Don't feel too bad about that. I love the Syria [ __ ], gangam style, yeah, um, I, I, approached him and I said: hey can I get a pic and you could tell he approached him. Yes, so you were doing a bit of a meme on him. Yeah well, I mean I, wasn't doing me well, yeah! Well, you're, like hey I, [, __, ], roasted your ass. Can I get a picture with you? Yes, it's a bit of a meme, but but you could tell he was hesitant, so I said I'm, not posting it anywhere or I'm, not posting. What the caption is. What I said. It's just me picture with the legend Rafi yeah, so I just took a picture. It was friendly enough interaction and he said I was like listen man, no hard feelings. It was just a little trend, yeah yeah or something like that. Well, that's a gone way to put it yeah and he was like well I. Think would be really nice to have a dialogue or a discussion about or something like that and so very friendly way of hurting it and and later later, during the event me and Max, and a few others like we're all in a group setting, and we talked about YouTube Reddit and a few other things. So the whole thing was a very positive experience and I'm glad I it and the reason I was before I said it was humbling and it really was. It was like I felt, very uncomfortable, because I had made this video about him. I was like I'm deserving it's one of the reasons that I kind of dislike some of the commentary channels out there is a when they go in really hard. I'm, like you need to interact with these people, didn't make fun of in real life just to be reminded of what you're actually doing kind of thing right, yeah, so interacting with Roth. When you see his face and you're like, and then you realize horrible thing you said and you're like [ __ ] like exactly yeah. This is real life. You felt this [ __ ], yeah I thought the internet wall is no longer there I feet away from him, yeah yeah it becomes real, that's an interest! That's right! Also, it happens when your channel becomes big because then most of the times, the videos you make they're definitely gonna see right like when you're a small Channel. Exactly you don't know who's gonna watch your videos. I was much more loose with my lips on Twitter and everywhere else, when I was smaller, yeah, yeah and now I have to kind of if I say like when I was smaller, I would have without a heartbeat said some mean [ __ ] about peopIe, but now I would be like he's. My friend he's my friend I like him and he's wonderful Swede he's a Swede. Well, he's a sweet um, no I I 100% relate to that too. I mean there was a point when we started making our reaction videos when we're like. We would actually ask ourselves I wonder if they are gonna see this like we'd make a video but Vitaly or dj khaled or whoever the [ __ ] we're making. Finally, frank: invasion: we're like wow I, wonder if there's if they see this I wonder what they think about it. But then you get to the point where you're like I'm sure they saw this and I hope they don't sue me. Oh that's, not everyone's head incorporate incorporate faster, incorporate, incorporate YouTube's, crazy yeah. It is so you think that going to VidCon was overall positive. It was a very positive experience. I think um. Did you meet a lot of fans? Ah, not that many fans I mean there was a fair group of people, the more youtubers or celebrities or whatever that are in close proximity to each other. The more people are like it's, okay, to approach them sort of thing, whereas like if someone passes by it's just that one person is like I'm, not sure you guys is a pair Ethan and Eli. It's like that's. Definitely them and I got you yeah. Well, I! Think that's! A good point is maybe that's actually a good point when they see ela. Next to me, it's a confirmation under like low boom got him got him. I get approached more when I'm, with the boys, no yeah George the gang exactly when you're with the whole game. How do basics there with you guys uh, not typically, no, not he like, but he just like kind of satellites out of there. That's all [Music] I'm dropping the bomb right now. How do basic is in, but that's there's some theories. That's one of many figures. There's a theory that I'm how to base it. Yeah I decide that I wish I wish. I was yes or like that innominate anonymous thing, we're all how to basic yeah. You know: I'm, not I, confirm I'm, not, but I wished. I was [, __, ], I, love that guy yeah um. What's it like working with with Max and and George, and how do basic I love them all cuz, you fly out to Australia, you go out there for like a month mm-hmm and you work with well yellow less than a month, but yeah a couple weeks feels like a month and you work with these insane. Yes, filthy Frank, máximo phone howtobasic, which are like the three nuttiest channels on YouTube, yeah and then, and one I think we are big you're big exposure before the Leafeon keemstar thing was was from working with these guys Korea. Well, your channel just went crazy, um, so yeah was it like. What's it like? Oh, it's awesome, they're, all very different uh. How to basic is like the funniest person on the planet. He's got it I want more from him. Yeah! Sorry! Well. The fact that he can, just like he's, been doing this for like five years, where he just breaks eggs on [, __, ] and even somehow he's managed to keep that fresh and entertaining yeah. That is just a testament to his genius. Yeah he's a genius. It's insane a bit lazy, though he should upload a lot more get on your [ __ ] howdy. He security, I, think yeah. Right now. It's been I think like two weeks since he's uploaded something well it's hard to make it's! No! What about cleaning up afterwards I mean yeah. It takes a little while to clean up but like if you guys, don't that's what I do has that [ __ ] cleaned up in a day yeah his videos are short, though so it's kind of sucks too. It's very similar to animation. He works hard yeah. He makes a huge mess. He spends a lot of money and he doesn't get paid very well cuz. His videos are short. That's how YouTube works, correct, longer, videos, you get paid more mm-hmm, yeah, yeah and then max Oh, like like we said earlier, I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for max. He was watching my videos before anyone else was then I had like 20k subscribers he's watching my videos really cool. That's he can he he it's so funny, it's so funny to see actual like I'll post memes, that only people will understand if they, if they had watched like a really old, Kickstarter, crap and Max knows all those can. He can quote my videos word for word and these people who are like I've, been a fan since 100 subs. They don't [, __ ], know the [ __ ]. That's so he's actually number one I do. Yeah Max is a legend that I love max. Also he's so up-to-date with like this guy I swear to God. If I wanted to like, if there was a youtube trivia game show here, we're doing my team healed it. We never in LA I need to have his ass on this podcast for a YouTube, trivia, TV, yeah, yeah. Trivia, no, like this guys, are worth knowledge like. If I ever have a question. Med obscure youtuber like who is this and what's going on here, I shoot him a DM and he's like yeah. After after, like 30 seconds, you see, the blue dot show up, and it's like a Wikipedia article, yeah I'm like thanks, dawg yeah. Oh we like whenever there's an interesting conversation on Twitter Max is always involved with some snipe yeah yeah yeah Max is great and of course we don't. Even you say it. George's you're he's just a [ __ ] clown, I, [, __, ], hate, George I think he sucks yeah get filthy Frank we're talking about he's a real monster and he has a big drug problem. Yeah he's gonna talk about that, but he's on drugs a lot, it's a bad thing. Well, they should believe it it's true. He smokes a lot of meth. He passed me. The key brings me every time when we're at our house. No, my dog, I, don't I'm like I'm married I have work like I. Can't you see he was just whittling on an apple set. I'm gonna make a pipe out of this dude and that's actually real. Why? Why we're just hanging like crab ooh grab a beer or water dude chill have a water duck. Another apple, cider, yeah, no I'm kidding actually I was gonna say we have the same story with George. He was the first, that's true who found our channel? Well, not the first, but like the beat really big youtuber we'll find out, and he was watching our stuff for like so long ago, like all the old, embarrassing videos, he was watching that that's really cool, it's so cool. The embarrassing stuff is the best yeah he one of our biggest breaks was when we probably were so small and George had like this. He was like a [ __, ] god to us back then like filthy Frank, and he had a huge Facebook page and he posted. We made this video Ainsley Harriott, exe and she's like what we sued these video edits, and he never does it, but he posted that video on his Facebook page, yeah and I think we got like you know. 500 subscribers, that day or something I was like our biggest day ever we had like our sub page open. We were refreshing, oh that's so fun and he left a comment on one of our old videos. It was like a get rekt like one of our yeah yeah and he's like man. You guys he said something really: nice I'm like and people like clap, clap, come and in my mom, like yeah, [, __ ]. Of course, I want to clap. I was like yeah, you want to do it and he's like yeah. Eventually, when we actually moved to I think we ended up we're talking and on Twitter Dean buy something, but he was there. He was there when no one else was yeah like George's is one of the sweetest [ __ ], most genuine guys, yeah and he's a pintar to helping us I'd suck his dick I have no, what again yeah I love that [ __ ], when it's so genuine when you're like it. Basically a local sub count and like they they if they can quote one of your videos, it's pretty good. It's! So that's like yeah, that's the best. It's [, __ ] gay when they're doing public. No, but it's brutal George does that public no math.max! Well, occasionally like try to embarrass me, but yeah, hey, that's pretty good, a really [ __ ] loud I'm. Like you, see hey, he created you dude yeah, pretty much! That's his attitude he's like [ __, ], this guy, yeah and uh. Who else was it there's one other people, snipers, snipers and jontron and jontron yeah, John, John and George were: are [ __ ], that's really nice, yeah yeah! God bless him. It's so important. Coming up, I feel like no youtuber can make it to like a high level without some some help. Right for the most part, unless you're like rice, gum or wolfy or leafy, who, just like all of a sudden YouTube's like I, choose you you know and like the invisible YouTube hand, just propels you to the job like I feel like you need some help. Yeah absolutely and those were our guys yeah and your guys were you had the same guy [ __ ] Georgia is a st. George max and yeah -.
