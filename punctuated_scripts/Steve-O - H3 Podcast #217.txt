Today your host, the fresh prince of dead air, brings you one of our most, maybe most cherished guests of all time. Stevo a man who needs no introduction at all is with us here via the power of zoom, and I do want to tell you stevo before we get into any conversation at all ian, can you please pull up stevo's wiki page? So it's customary here on the issue podcast to rate our guests wiki feet. Are you aware of what keeps oh wow dude I've heard about this? It's a uh like a foot, fetish thing, huh, yeah, and actually I have to give it up to you, my dude. You have a pretty solid rating nice 4.53. So that's definitely something to be proud of there. That's crazy, because on my podcast, which is of course, called wild ride with stevo, I'm always barefoot and I always get [ __ ] comments about dude wash your feet. Your [ __ ] feet are disgusting. Okay, so that's that's like it's. My disgusting unclean feet, which uh are responsible for my high rating huh. Oh, that wonders straight on wiki yeah wow. I think you just lost some points. Oh yeah, I don't know dude, maybe my other, maybe maybe the other foot will bring it up. Yeah. I don't know man like so stevo. I watched your new comedy special gnarly brad. Thank you man. It was horrific and beautiful all at once. It's on stevo.com for 10 bucks, apparently no streaming service would pick it up because it was just so obscene. Is that right, basically yeah it uh? It's got a lot of dicks. Well, it has just my dick. It's got a lot of my dick. It's got uh. You know a lot of um heavy drugs um a lot of uh criminal activity grievous, grievous bodily harm. I really go: get [ __ ] up um, so between those things um, it was tough to get it anywhere and then, frankly, with the uh, you know the platforms that you know, I think could have put it out like netflix uh, you know probably hbo and showtime. I think that would be about it and their position, I think, was that uh viewing stevo as a crossover stand-up comedian. You know not a pure lifelong stand-up comedian that I'm not prestigious enough to give a stand-up comedy special too, and that absolutely drove me nuts man that [ __ ]. That drove me nuts, because what I did with it like I, I don't think it's ever been done before to have uh fully multimedia stand-up comedy with uh. You know because most comedians, I think their stories that they're telling aren't true to begin with, and in my case not only are they true, but I've got the footage to like really illustrate the stories and uh [ __ ] man. I just thought that between having the multimedia component and bringing the whole cast of jackass together to do such awesome, [ __ ]- for it that it was a no-brainer, a slam, dunk and I'd and, like you said I couldn't [ __ ] sell it man so was there anybody did it? Was anyone interested in they're like okay? We can do this, but you have to remove all the dicks and the gore and all this [ __ ] or is it all I never um? I never would have edited anything out, but it didn't come to that yeah it. So it didn't come to that, and I I mean honestly, I felt like uh, dr dre, when uh I was watching his uh defiant ones, series on hbo. He said that they had the chronic. You know the chronic and he brought it to all the record labels and they all passed on it and uh and he's like I knew it was [ __ ] great. I think that's maybe why he started aftermath records. You know- and I was like just so [ __ ] pissed- that I I couldn't sell it. I thought it was just like such a slam, dunk millions of dollars and um. I ended up putting it out on my own website, which in hindsight might have been [, __ ], awesome too. It might have been completely rad because and I'll tell you the business of it. You know I spent just to shoot the [ __ ] thing like a quarter million dollars easy just the night in the theater. I forget what was it uh, 120, 170 or something, but I shot so many different things like to to build into it like that opening sequence, which I'm so stoked that when I was with you, we recorded the podcast. Last time I told you, I was like man, they're gonna duct tape me to a side of a truck and I'm gonna drive to vegas and we ended up doing it in denver. So the opening sequence. You see me riding duct tape to the side of this truck, all the way to denver and uh that plus all the other. You know special scenes we shot for it. It was a [, __, ], quarter million bucks. By the time I filmed it easy I figured it would cost more than that yeah yeah right, oh well, then getting it out on my website took it like over 300 000, oh wow yeah, because there was a lot in in uh. You know in uh, like promotion, hiring the publicist with mixing you know, and then I bought the [ __ ] billboard to promote it. You know right right with the hollywood sign in the background and then I [ __ ] hired two two uh cranes. I had a [ __, ] construction team with two cranes and and got me all up on the [ __ ], billboard uh so yeah. It was a lot but uh. Thankfully I made my money back yeah and some good like uh. I checked it last night and um and uh with like having spent 300 grand like I've brought in 523 000. So that's I'm in the profit zone. Thank god for that. Well, now, it's all it's all just money, and I think I think people if they go over to siva.com and watch gnarly they're, going to be very satisfied with their ten dollars. This man died nearly died for this [ __ ] yeah. I appreciate that man. I appreciate that a lot and uh my philosophy is that um you know I that I really think anybody who does stream it from stevo.com is going to be thoroughly happy with it, because this project marries all of my worlds together into one. You know, and it's like not only am I not uh [ __ ] any wiser or you know, like I'm doing, dumber [ __ ] than ever yeah. You know what I was like man I was just wondering like when? Is he gonna get too old for this [ __ ]? Because your body cannot be getting stronger or more durable as you age and the [ __ ] that you're doing in this is is crazier than anything. You've done right at what point are you just gonna have to call it a day on this stuff. Dude I've got the next uh I mean, depending on when um you know the world opens back up. So to speak. I mean I've got the net. I've got the next project, [ __ ] done you know like um. The the the follow-up to gnarly is is [ __ ] finished man um and I've been touring with it because I'm yeah, I'm so [ __ ] pissed about this dude. I taped the gnarly special in january of 2018., so I it didn't come out until I'd been [, __ ] sitting on it for two and a half years, and and and when I failed to get anybody to [ __ ] buy it it which drives me [, __, ], crazy, just to say that but um like I didn't get discouraged and say like okay, I'm gonna [, __ ]. You know just hang it up. Whatever nobody was interested, [ __ ] that I doubled down dude I doubled down and I knew exactly what the follow-up to gnarly was going to be because uh, I was because I the thing about gnarly there's all this storytelling and then each bit in the act inspires like a crazy new stunt, and I was just excited about making the follow-up like no more [ __, ] memory, lane [ __ ], like 100 brand new like over the just over the top stuff and then the question of what to do next, like I already had the answer because like for all these last 20 years since jackass started, there's been like a handful of ideas that I had and just never [ __ ] thought I was gonna. Do them. You know like they were just like the go-to like I was skydiving like only if I'm butt naked, with the tandem instructor strapped to my back and I'm furiously jacking off, and I time it so I fall out of the airplane. While I'm coming everywhere, disgusting yeah, it's called skyjacking, that's the closer for the bucket, the bucket. That's what this new! This new one is called the bucket list and, like I had you know, for decades, I had the idea to get a vasectomy and right after I get the vasectomy go like get on a horse bare, back horseback riding, bouncing up and down on my balls and like and and like dressed up as a pinata, with all the kids hitting me in the balls with with a stick there, the vasectomy olympics. So did you do that? Oh yeah? You got engaged at the end of the special congratulations. I mean it's really beautiful seems like a really beautiful, wholesome relationship. I knew she was special when she encouraged you to eat your burned dead skin. So that was a really uh touching moment in the in gnarly yeah dude. Thank you, man, yeah she's. Definitely the one and uh. There was another moment if I could interject when she injected the hot sauce into your uh [ __ ]. I thought that was a really beautiful uh. I realized you guys were kindred spirits, then as well yeah for sure man. I appreciate that a lot yeah. She never wanted. Kids, I don't want kids um, you know it's uh, yeah [, __ ], it dude we're all about animals. Yeah dogs are great yeah. We have four dogs, we have uh two cats. We've got three goats like all right here at our house. I wanted to ask you about uh your animal rights advocacy because it's always been something that stood out to me is interesting. You've lived such a crazy life um. What is it about animals? I mean of all the causes you could take up in the world. Why is it that you're so passionate about animal animal rights? Um? You know it uh. I I think I can. I can distill this down to a pretty bite-sized, uh timeline. When I was at ringling brothers and barnum and bailey clown college. You know, I think it's pretty well known that my career began as a circus clown and when I was in clown college. The public relations department for the ringling brothers and barnum and billy circus paid us a visit and they said some of you are going to be working for the the greatest show on earth. The ringling brothers, barnum billy circus and what that's going to entail is is arriving in the city like a week in advance of the circus to do uh interviews to promote you know and when you're doing these interviews, some people are going to ask you about animal abuse. You know like with the with the elephants all the tigers, everything in the circus and if you, if and when you get asked about animal abuse, you shut the [ __ ] up. You have no opinion, you're a [, __ ] clown. You fall down, you don't say anything. You know like that's how I remember them kind of coming at us and I thought well [ __ ]. The way that they're approaching this with us seems like it's really [ __ ] shady. You know. So if I, if I could point to a moment where animal abuse and animal rights like first occurred to me, because I never never even thought of it before that and I thought man, maybe the circus is [ __ ] up, then I went on to work in the circus and not not the ringling circus. But I worked in another circus that had three elephants and a tiger and dude the [ __ ] circus owners were more terrified of their own elephants than anybody in the audience. The tiger went from its whole life from one box to another box back and forth, and both boxes were like the [ __ ] length of the tiger's body. I was, I was kind of [ __ ] upset about it. You know like the elephant and I was like [ __ ]. This then uh, you know my last day. Working in the circus was my first day of filming jackass. It was just that, like I washed off my clown makeup knives with knoxville like they [ __ ] filmed my last performance and then I was off you know with jackass. After that, once I had a platform and uh, you know I'm doing like talking to big audiences. I would [ __ ] about the animals in the circus. I was like [ __ ] that dude I was in the circus and [ __ ] that man, those animals are abused, and so then you know when I went on one of my rants about the animal abuse and the circus. Then the people from peta reached out to me and said hey. Could we get you to say that for for peta and I was like [ __ ] yeah, I'm an attention, [ __ ], you got a camera, I'm in and uh, and so I did that and then I've never supported peta on, like you know, across the board, because they've got some wacky views man, I don't back everything that they're about, but what I did was just gradually kind of bit by bit on an issue by issue basis. I became more in you know I was like I was like you know: I don't [ __ ] uh yeah. I won't wear fur because I don't eat. Mink was my first thing. They said, oh cool, we'll do an anti-fur campaign and I graduate and then when I was so out, of control on drugs and hallucinating everywhere with all that, and that was one of the most popular things from our last podcast was the ghost stories where I was talking about all the [ __ ], crazy experience. I had with spirit [ __ ], ghost [, __, ] and and when I was when I was like watching people walk around and walk through walls and all this [ __ ]. I was like so in love with the experience of it, and I was so interested to learn about like what the [ __ ] was going on with the spirit world and so there I am with all my drugs piles of [, __, ], coke and nitrous all this crazy [, __, ] and uh. I'm researching spirit world like watching youtube videos, and I saw this [ __ ], like harry krishna guy from india, or something and he's this wise guru, man and he says how can you expect to be saved if you eat meat? You know- and he was just like you know, and I was like right there I was like boom [ __ ]. I want to be saved, you know, so that was where I I stopped eating meat except for fish, and I just it just came more and more. You know the more when I got sober like if I could make decisions based on kind of just being compassionate, then that helped build up my self-esteem. You know like I had I had it pretty low, where I was you know just kind of you know. My life was not good and I built myself back up by making decisions that I could be proud of and and a lot of that was uh just turning my attention to animals. Why is it that fish always get the the exception? I always wondered that I would me too man. That was when I first decided, but I'm gonna keep eating fish. It was because I said uh well. Eating fish has to be cool because [ __ ] jesus was a fisherman. You know I. I no longer believe that jesus had [ __ ]. Anything to do with fish or fishermen or or fishing uh, but I gotta say that I went back to eating fish. I was vegan for uh [, __ ]. I was vegan for years and then I went back to eating fish uh for a couple reasons: number one um. I think it's good for me. Number two. I've got all these animals that I can't feed a vegan diet, you know and so giving fish to my that's all my you know the dog food everything the cat food. I like I I limit it at fish and and I'm like what am I gonna feed the [ __ ] fish to my pets and not eat it myself. I think it's good. For me, it is good for you yeah. I just I find that a lot of vegetarians just they there's this one. Like uh kurt cobain line. He says it's okay to eat fish because they don't have any feelings. You know, that's not true. They did yeah, they told they totally have feelings. They totally have feelings. They totally have their families. They have [. __ ], like you, know, emotions I believe all that, but that what helps me a little bit is that you know the most horrifying of all is factory farming right. You know like it's just factory farming with the eggs, and you know the all the the chicken just the the conditions that they have animals living in farms is awful, yeah and and and with wild caught fish. In my view, that fish had a great life just roaming around swimming in the ocean, you know and then it got [, __, ] caught and and then you know it had its death. Everything dies, but you know I think death is pretty easy in the grand scheme of things it's going to happen anyway. It's it's how you live. That's important and I like to think even if it's naive, that the fish that I eat had a good life swimming around, you know yeah, I think that's! A fair observation is a guy like you afraid of death. I wonder because you you squirt by it yeah. Are you really, though, are you really like totally unafraid of death? I mean I'm afraid of suffering. Yeah- and I think that that's the I think the actual being dead has to be okay, otherwise we're really [ __ ]. You know yeah um like like. I can't. I can't subscribe to an idea that being dead is a bad thing. You know being dead is not death itself. I'm not worried about. You know it's like the idea of prolonged pain and suffering, yeah and um, and even more than that, I think. What's terrifying is uh, I'm not going to be here anymore. You know, like you, asked a big question, you know, and mortality is it's not necessarily? Oh I'm going to be dead, but, like I'm not going to be here anymore, you know like we have uh as as humans. We have only one instinct, which is to survive right and we have only one guarantee. We won't survive. So like wait, a second hold like hold on here. The one [ __ ] thing that matters to us. Above all else, the one [ __ ] thing we're trying to avoid is the only thing that we can be sure of. So this is like some kind of a [ __ ] catch-22 like prank on us. What the [ __ ] is this human experience, but a [ __ ] awful joke, where the one thing we're passionate about is the only [ __ ], it's it's [, __ ], the innovation yeah right. So I I view that as really the big picture of the human experience is to one way or another wrap your head around your mortality, you know to come to terms with okay, like I'm gonna die and how's. That okay and I think that there are three ways that people typically have done it throughout history, number, one being to reproduce. You know there's this idea that yeah I'll be gone, but my legacy will live on. I'm gonna have children who you know, keep me alive. You know and like we've covered, that I don't [ __ ] want to reproduce you know so that doesn't work for me. I think the other way, the other way people wrap their head around death is uh religion. You know where they subscribe to some like sort of fairy tale notion that uh, you know if they do x, y or z, that they're going to be in heaven and everything's. So that's, oh, you know I'm going to be dead, but I'll be in heaven and like the idea of a heaven which is exclusive to people who subscribe to one absurd belief is [ __ ], just pisses me off man. You know I grew up with people of all faiths and like if they're, not all, welcome in heaven, then [ __ ] it I don't want to go. You know they just religion. I've always had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder. So that's not my gig and then the third way, the that we sort of come to terms with death. You know I like, like the [ __ ] caveman scrawling, the [ __ ], stick figures on the cave wall because they know they're gonna be dead, but their [ __ ] stick figures will outlive them. You know now. That's me 100! That's me! That's where I turned to the video camera. You know, as a failing college student, I was like dude, I'm gonna fail at life because I can't keep a job and I can't [ __ ] go to class, I can't survive, but before I [ __ ] die man. I'm gonna load up my message into the bottle: I'm gonna [ __, ], videotape, crazy, [, __, ] and those videos are gonna, live on. So when I'm dead, like it'll, be cool because I'll still be alive with the [ __ ] immortality of the video. Can I ask yeah this is kind of like a broad question, but you ever think about like how you ended up the way you are. You know what I mean. I know exactly at a young age. You were like already living way too fast and too hard. You know what the clown college and the drug use, and just like you just said yourself, you didn't plan. I don't think to live very long. I didn't. I didn't expect to see the age of 30.. I never you know and from the from when I was eight, I don't think I was I'd ever like. I had the idea I was gonna, be dead, yeah yeah did you have drama sort of here's? This is real simple because, like the the my mom's side of the family, is a hundred percent alcoholic a highlight like it's alcohol, drugs gambling suicide like this is just the whole every leaf on the tree. You know like uh, my mom, her brother and her sister. There were three siblings all dead from alcoholism. 100, you know cirrhosis, like you know, like you know, like whatever all the way up. As far as anybody can remember, every single person died of alcoholism. Suicide, like you know, whatever um, so there's this kind of deviance. Of course, with that said, my mom was the the smart one. My mom was the funny one. My mom was the one with the personality, then my my dad's side of the family was a hundred percent uh theologians, [ __, ] clergy men. You know like decorated, academics like super decorated, academics and my dad was uh sort of the black sheep of the family for going into business. You know they were like nobody ever on. My dad's side of the family made a lot of money, but they were just respected: [, __, ], good ass people and my dad was this hustler. You know he [ __ ] top of his class. He went on to become uh the president of pepsi cola in all of brazil, the president of nabisco, like I, grew up in a privileged ass upbringing and and uh, and it's like I'm a hybrid of these two family trees. You know it's like I've got my dad's, my dad's drive my dad's [ __, ] hustle and that's the engine for my mom's deviance. You know I'm just this [ __ ] alcoholic deviant just with hustle. So did your mom kind of what was it like growing up with your mom? Did she was there moments where you kind of saw either that dark side of her or, like she kind of oh yeah? Did she abuse you? No? No! No, there wasn't any abuse but um. I was born in england, and my family moved to brazil when I was just six months old, so um. That was because dad got the job of president of pepsi cola in all of brazil and they were ballin dude. They were the [ __ ] was popping off man like when you're living in brazil, and you have like this kind of status like it's. I mean the cost of living was cheap as [ __ ]. So if you're making, if you're making any kind of real money living in brazil you're bawling and they were like ball and balling, so they had live-in maids, which uh you know essentially raised me. You know like I, I actually spoke my first words in portuguese, because the only people [ __ ] paying attention to me were the live-in maids who spoke portuguese. So it's not like hard to imagine. You know how I became such a [ __ ] attention, [ __ ], because mom and dad weren't paying any attention to me and that's not because they were abusive or you know they were just balling and [ __, ], partying and like didn't have time. So I think that there's a big component in that that makes me like really over developed, my need for attention and uh and as such I'm uh I like to consider myself a world-class attention. [ __ ], yes for sure you've achieved a lot through that the singular yeah. But so you know I stumbled onto a really great character defect. Yeah, exactly you've worked it to your advantage for sure. So your debt was your mom working. When you guys were in brazil, she wasn't. She went to nursing school and I want to say that she dropped out of nursing school um when she married my dad and to my mom's credit, my dad when they married had not uh had like huge success. You know my wife was not jumping on the bandwagon of uh, my mom. She like dad hadn't done [, __ ], yet and and and he did it, he succeeded after marrying my mom, which I think is really cool yeah, that is nice. Your dad was in your special or do you hold any grudges or resentments to your parents still as a as you? No, no! No! No! No, no, no, not at all, not at all and with my dad uh it's it's so rad to me that that my dad uh didn't jump on any bandwagons with with me. You know just kind of figuring things out like um. I I had this crazy dad wasn't supportive of me dropping out of college. He was not [ __ ] feeling clown college. He he [ __ ] hated. Every word I had to say about: I'm gonna become a crazy famous stuntman. He [ __ ] hated, all of it and uh and and and to his credit. It was before I um before I had ever even made a [ __ ] penny being a dumbass [ __ ] stuntman that my dad came to me and he said hey. I gotta tell you. I feel I've done a disservice to you by not supporting you in this career path that you're clearly committed to you know and uh, and he said I feel like I've done a disservice, and I want you to know that sure you didn't choose what I would have wanted you to do, but I see that you're committed. I just want you to be the best and I've got your back. You know he gave and I think a lot of fathers have had that talk with their kids. You know he said: okay, my uh, my dad said that how his his dad totally didn't support him going into business. You know, I said it was the black sheep, a capitalist, greedy scumbag in a business suit. My dad was like yeah he's like and his his dad had the same talk with him, I'm going to throw to a quick break and then, when we come back, we will continue this conversation with stevo.

When you put that condom full of weed in you. How did you not die from that like that? Was insane? Okay, yeah! I mean well again, thank you so much for watching it dude. I really. I love everything about that. Damn gnarly, special and uh. You know the idea for the drug smuggling bit where, in the special I get arrested for international drug smuggling, it came from staying at this chick's house. There was a period when I first moved out to la where chris pontius and I were both completely homeless, and we had this running competition to see who could stay homeless the longest. Despite the fact that now we were earning enough money to be able to rent an apartment, you know it was like. It was this funny game that we were playing and at a certain point we were both staying at this girl's house. She was out of town. We were uh house-sitting, taking care of her dog, which was this little 10 pound like [ __, ], terrier whatever, and so chris and I come back from the bar with these two chicks we're in this girl's place and we both in separate rooms, are humping these. These danish chicks right they're, both from denmark and uh. As per usual. I had this little habit where I took off my soiled condom and like would tie it in a knot and, like you know that would like swirl it around be like yeah, you know and would throw it right like. So I did that in in this girl's house threw my tied under knot rubber through it and then I'm or whatever. At the time, I've smoked cigarettes, I'm smoking a cigarette and I remember seeing the little 10 pound dog coming running into the room and it runs out of the room and I'm like okay, you know that's uh, but then after I get done with my cigarette, I get up and I look on the ground like where's the condom like it's not here and I'm thinking. Oh no. So in my view this is the worst because the girl whose house we were staying at had a boyfriend. You know and like if this dog picked up the condom and took it on like a little victory, lap and dropped it somewhere else where the [ __ ], boyfriend's gonna, find it in her place, like that's gonna, be a problem, so I'm all kinds of [, __ ] stressed out about it and like and then- and I can't find it anywhere and then even worse what if the dog swallowed the [ __ ] thing and it gets tangled up in the dog's intestines or something and like string. You know the dog dies because it [ __ ] gobbled, my rubber. So I was like the rest of the time at this girl's house, I'm like walking the dog. I'm like you know like checking every you know when the dog poops. I think I forget how long it was it wasn't too long, but I woke up from a crazy drug bender at like [, __, ], six and six pm, or something and right next to the bed I was sleeping in is this piece of [ __ ] dog poop, which just morphed into my rubber? You know it was like it was like half log and hammered yeah and and like, and I grabbed my camera and [ __ ] uh. I grabbed my camera and and lifted it up by the ring of the rubber and it the the rubber gets like all straightened out and once it really once it's fully straight. The the piece of dog poo is just sticking out perpendicular in the middle. You know, and you can see the whole load of [ __ ] was was intact in the you know. After passing through the whole dog that whole the whole load was just perfectly intact in the rubber and uh. You know I put it out on my first uh, my first dvd, which I actually just uploaded into this video library at stevo.com. When you see the first stevo, don't try this at home video and career ender, that's on there, but uh, but yeah. So I felt like [ __, ]. Okay, thank god. We figured that out. I got a cool piece of footage out of it, but I felt [ __ ] bad. When mike comes coming out of that dog's, [ __ ], it's not it's not a lot different than the dog being sodomized by me. You know just the comes going in the other direction. You know and uh, and I felt that I owed it to that dog somehow, and so I was like okay, you know if the dog can swallow a condom and have it come out all intact, then I should be able to as well so that was the birth of the idea. How am I gonna? What am I gonna do swallowing a condom and then, when I went on the europe tour I said dude I'm going to load up a condom with [ __ ] weed in one country and then fly to the next country and [ __ ] it out and smoke it, and so that was the where the idea, but it turned into this crazy debacle because, like zach said it would [, __ ] thing wouldn't come out and I thought I was going to die because it was going to block up all of my [ __ ]. You know you stuck a lot. I think you put you put a lot of weed in there a lot I know, and I yeah I didn't even think I did. It was stuck in my throat. You know like it was the most. It was the most [ __ ] scary thing, and then everyone was telling me that, like you can get blockage in your intestines and, like you know, and and like, and I saw, I was really worried that I was gonna die of intestinal strangulation and uh. I [ __ ]. I expressed these concerns to every media outlet that I talked to that was just like and and they're not [, __ ] cool about drugs in sweden. They really aren't so so yeah. It came out in the newspaper that I had drugs in my body before the drugs were out of my body and uh. The cops [ __ ] swooped in to [ __ ] nail me for international drug smuggling. The whole story is crazy and it's in the gnarly special. So by all means please go over to uh, stevo.com and uh and stream that [ __ ] there's the that's like the most square, [ __ ]. I ever heard like apparently there's so little going on in sweden. The cops arrested you and then made you [ __ ] in a cup for a week to check for the weed yeah it wasn't a cup, it was a bag, it was it was. It was a [ __, ] uh a little yeah. It was a toilet that had like a bag set up in the bowl. Oh that's so so this isn't the first time they've dealt with this issue. [Laughter] right, I get it so the most discussed I mean the part that stands out to me from gnarly is the jet fuel accident yeah. You laid in jet fuel and got third degree burns all over your body, and you didn't go to the hospital for like a week too. So everything was all infected and [ __ ] and then of course, as I mentioned earlier, your your our fiance or not wife. Is it uh still haven't gotten married. We're we're waiting to buy a big farm that we're gonna get married on. Oh perfect, fiance uh was encouraging you to because your skin was just coming off and peels and and then you started eating it. How was that experience? I mean you tossed it down real fast, but that technically makes you a cannibal. Doesn't it it does man I got what it was was that that you know the skin was just the skin was just falling off my body wholesale and as each patch came off, I I threw him into the toilet. I threw it all and then it just occurred to me like looking in the toilet and all this skin floating in there. I was just like that. Is the sight to behold. You know, that's something, that's something! That's pretty [ __ ] remarkable right. I was like okay, so I got my girl to film and I scooped it out of the toilet, and then we had this whole conversation about. I was like. I should not eat that and she's like quiet, I'm like you're you're. Your silence is speaking volumes. You know like you want me to eat this and she's like so. Does she not gag during that? Does she have a really strong stomach to be able to watch you do that? It's so interesting. How, like, like the the workings of my girl's, mind like the things that she's perfectly comfortable with like, are just outrageous. You know like she didn't gag. She was like totally supportive of like yeah [ __ ] eat your skin. That's great! You know, you know like uh, she filmed me drinking the blister juice and and had no problem. Oh yeah, I wanted to ask you about that. We'll work up into that and and for anybody, that's concerned that this might all be too gross. Keep in mind. That's I saved that for the end, you know me getting third degree burns all over my body and skin graft surgery and all of this stuff we're describing right now is the closer for the gnarly specialist after you, after you eat your own flesh and by the way so you're like there's a moment where their flesh is kind of peeling off and you're jiggling it, and you can see, there's like actually just liquid in there like. What kind of is that liquid? That liquid is the body's response to burns? You know like it's, it was just blister juice and I was just burned so [ __ ] badly that I had not like blisters, but I had huge bags of blister juice. You ever wish they'd bottle that stuff for you. I don't wish they bottled it, but it is. It is fascinating that um, you know, that's the body's response, that's why there is juice in the blister. It's your body's way of trying to cool it down. You know, like your body, sends out. You know it sends out this liquid to just try to cool down the area and when I drank it, uh as as disgusting as it looked like you know, all, yellow and and [ __ ]. You know crazy, looking um, it honestly didn't taste like anything man, it didn't, it did not taste salty, it didn't just it just tasted like water, um, bro, it didn't look and that [ __ ] that [ __ ] was so gross. I saved that for like the [ __ ] credits, yeah. Well, you know yeah. He takes the knife and punctures it and then you fill up really a whole shot. Glass of it- and I was like oh no- I mean I- I ended up with skin grafts on 15 of my body, and so all of that was like blisters, just all over me and uh the big bags, I think, just I don't know yeah. I was [ __ ], so you you described the doctors being shocked that you didn't come into the hospital early. Do you think you would have died if you didn't go in because it seemed like? I don't know, I don't know that I would have died, but god I that that was the worst [ __ ] pain, I've ever experienced and and and and the saving grace of that is that by far the question I've been asked, the most over the years is what was the most painful stunt. You know like what hurt the most and the question like up until that point. That question was just like frustrating to me because, because there was no good answer I would say I would be like first like frustrated that I got asked the question again and then I would say: well, there are different criteria for pain. You know there's the acuteness of the pain like say, for example, if you get tased, you know like electricity very acute, but it's it's quick. You know. The most important criteria to me is the duration of the pain. You know like pain that lasts for, like you know a week or two weeks is uh. You know way more upsetting to me than so. There's all these different criteria and then, when I got the third degree burns like that, it checked every [, __ ] box man, because the show was because the [ __ ], like I mean even after I had the skin graft surgery for to get more weeks. It was the [ __ ], unbearable pain. You know like on the the level of acute pain. Duration like I went on a whole like tour of burning it after that, and I heard over and over that people who have been shot like with guns- and you know and or stabbed, will all say that uh, that's nothing compared to third degree. Burns like universally third-degree burns are known as the most [ __ ] horrific pain, and so I have an answer to the question now you can ask me: what's what hurt the most not be like yeah man, [, __, ], fire angels, yeah power angels for sure bro? You know it's funny because you seem so happy before the prank went off you're like fire angels. Let's do it yeah. Would you would you not do it or would you do it again? I mean dude, that's the thing like. If I knew that was gonna happen, I would it would be a really tough decision to [ __ ] to go through with it. You know, thank god. Time doesn't operate that way where you can go back because, like I mean I wouldn't trade it for nothing, you know. Let me let let me show you right here, the uh, the t-shirt that I was wearing. I'm gonna [ __ ] break the fourth wall a little bit like I was [ __ ] wearing nice yeah dude. I mean that surprised, prized possession right there yeah. I remember when you stood up the whole back of your ass was burned off like a comic book yeah. Another anecdote from from gnarly is that when you were protesting sea world, you climbed up on this crane and were shooting off fireworks and the city. The response was so insane they sent like swat teams and like 20 officers and fire department, 80 firefighters, why I mean what and then a swap? Why would they send a swat team? It's a really good question. Yeah well like that, doesn't even make any sense. Well, it doesn't make any sense, but I mean I think that the explanation is that, because the crane was 150 feet up in the air that it was impossible to tell uh who it was climbing up on that crane or why they were climbing up on that crane and the backpack that I was wearing um. You know which had my inflatable killer whale, and you know other you know my fireworks and stuff. Maybe I was some kind of a terrorist, I don't know. Maybe I guess the times were a little wild yeah. It follows that it would have made some sense to do a little bit of investigation before deploying so many uh first responders, but you know what what can I do? I can't second guess it uh and- and I deserved all the trouble I got in for that. I legitimately felt [ __ ] awful. I know they sent you a bill, so I was just wondering how much was the bill um? I approached it um as uh. My investment was in um, the attorney. You know. I think that I uh I I got like the most impressive attorney that I could get in that situation and the attorney ended up costing more than the bill right for the restitution right, because I think that had it gone in front of uh, like a trial jury, you know, and the obvious question that would you know require an answer. Is the very question that you just asked why the [ __ ] did. They need a swat team. What was the purpose in 80 firefighters like? Why like why? The helicopter? Why why? All this? Like you know that was such an overblown overkill response and I think that it when it came down to uh, you know what what's called arbitration where they actually figure out like what should this [ __ ] have to pay. I think that the uh, the overblown response would uh, would really be under the microscope and um. So I'll go ahead and tell you dude, I spent 20 grand on the lawyer and, and he got the restitution uh at 14. Damn that's not bad. It's not bad. Like you can already. I gotta say you could you could really argue that that was [ __ ] totally worth it man? You know amazing. That's amazing work for 20 000 from that attorney too yeah and given how much um [ __ ] press there was. You know, like you know, it's not press that looking back on it, I'm particularly proud of you know it was [ __ ] idiotic, even though when uh and it was like there were rounds of press, there was when it happened, press all over the world, then they uh they [, __, ], sentenced me to 30 days in jail, and that was headline city. The fact like stevo, sentenced to 30 days in jail for a [, __, ] shamu, you know [ __ ] protesting sea world. It was. It was a little bit of a a [ __ ] total score, but to anybody who really looked at at what what it was. It was just so dumb doing it where I did it. It had nothing to do with sea world. You know like it was nowhere near sea world. It was all the first first responders. I was blowing up fireworks in in hollywood like during a drought like uh, you know with the hell, it was an [ __, ] move and- and I was on probation for uh for three years. I was on probation um and I had to do all kinds of community service they they. Let me do community service at animal shelters and uh for this um humane society program, where I went around uh underserved, neighborhoods, um, signing people up for free, spay and neuter for their pets. So I I was in [ __ ], heaven with my community service. That's great yeah. It was, it was killer and uh. You were sentenced to 30 days, but but what did you serve like five hours? How did that happen? Eight hours, eight hours, yeah I was from when I from dude they. Let me film. Turning myself to, I showed up at the [, __ ] and then dude. Thank god that I made my gnarly special multimedia because everything I talked about throughout the special you actually see. You know the footage of it had cut in and I think it worked so well, but I do I showed up at the the [ __ ] the. What do you call the correctional uh facility, the twin towers, jail to turn myself in for my 30-day sentence I climb up on the [ __ ] correctional facility, [ __ ] sign and do a backflip off of it like just like yeah here I am, I go in there and I'm like here. I am, I turn myself in they. Let it they. Let us film the whole [ __ ] thing like how we went how they like like they. Let us film them. Handcuffing me and leading me into the [ __ ] jail, which I cannot [, __, ], believe and um, and then they they uh basically took my picture and let me go, I mean it was eight hours from when I showed up at the jail to when I walked out of the jail and the reason for that is uh. Two things: um overcrowding. You know like they don't even want uh I mean I shouldn't say they don't want they. They don't have room to keep anybody who's, a non-violent offender, basically they're gonna they're, just and then on top of that they don't there's no upside for the jail uh in having a high profile. Uh inmate, there's no upside, like anything like bad happens that, like they view it all as liability and downside. So so yes, they. Let me out in [, __ ] eight hours which to me was hilarious. What was the eight hours like? What did you do in those eight hours? Uh I mean mostly it's just being processed in you know like uh you're you're in a holding cell. You know you're waiting for them to like get your fingerprints and uh. You know at one point like uh, I was picking out a book I was gonna read. You know like getting ready to settle in yeah. They were and um I mean I knew as well that I was going to be in protective custody. That's what it's called when you're a high-profile inmate. You know they they don't want. They don't want [ __ ] to deal with any [ __ ] of uh, like you being attacked or anything and so like and from back in the day it was my my uh second experience in that same uh, sort of high profile jail situation in the same facility, because I, when I was arrested for uh the other thing and I was facing eight years in prison uh I showed up in there and and- and they pulled me out of my cell- I just got in my bag tattoo and they pulled me out of my cell to take pictures of me they're, giving me like boxes of cookies. This is back in 2002. they're, like oh dude, uh, you're, you're, all good here, man, [ __, ] um. You know like uh. We call this robert downey jr unit, rather than because we call this the robert downey junior block, you know, and and uh, and the cell you're in right. Now that's odb cell he's, always in here you know and they're used to like treating the the celebrities nicely. I guess so pretty much man uh they were, they were they're. They were really cool to me back in 2002 and they were super cool to me, uh and whatever it was, it was a december of 2015.. What did you almost go to jail for eight years? For oh man, it was [, __, ], awful and uh. You know this is in the gnarly special. Where I talk about how I got arrested for stapling, my balls to my leg, but in fact in fact, uh there were two charges. One was felony obscenity, because this was this. This was in uh in in louisiana and and in louisiana. There's not counties like there are in the states. There's parishes and there's like sort of religious overtones and, like you know, like the new orleans, is this wild mardi gras party out of control, but once you get outside of new orleans, louisiana's pretty [ __ ] crazy in the way they operate, and I had a show outside of new orleans in louisiana in 2002 and during this show a couple things happened. I stapled my ball sack to my leg and as I did this- and this is with the the old tour which I promoted by saying I will be drunk and on drugs or your money, yeah yeah, or your money back and in every show on stage. I would get drunk [ __ ] on stage pounding tequila out of the bottle. I would have audience members [, __, ], chugging bottles of tequila. It was a [ __, ] liability, central [, __ ] show, and I was on drugs every time and and as I was uh covered in blood like every show I was covered in blood. I was barfing all over the stage like uh, because I would break a light bulb over my head and slash my tongue, so I was bleeding all over myself. This was every night. It was every [ __ ] night and I would staple them staple my balls to my leg during the show like uh I'd, be set on fire. I'd, [ __ ] be pissing into it. I'd be sick, pissing into a cup and I'd be like who wants to drink. My piss and people would be like yeah, so I'd bring people on yeah people would be jumping up and down who wants to get kicked in the nuts dude. It was a [ __ ]. It was a [, __, ] up circus, dude and uh at one point at the point that night in louisiana, when I was stapling my balls to my leg, I just happened to say under the microphone. I said this is not art. This is strictly to be offensive. I don't even know why I said that, because it's totally art you know and uh, and somebody in the crowd was videotaping right. It wouldn't have been a big deal like the stapling of the balls to my leg. While I was covered in blood saying that I was just trying to be offensive, but at another point in the show that bottle of tequila that I mentioned, I had it sitting on the stage like towards the front of the stage and at one point somebody kind of crawled up onto the stage and grabbed the bottle. Now the bouncers noticed this happening. They were not they [ __ ] zipped. Over with lightning speed and [ __ ], incredible efficiency and [ __ ] got that bottle. Back from this person, I was impressed by the bouncers response to this theft of my tequila bottle. These bouncers, as it would turn out, were for football players for the local college team, which I think was a pretty successful college team. Well, in any case, these huge bouncers, these huge bouncers impressed me. So I just off the cuff impromptu. I said to the crowd. I said to the crowd: these bouncers are [ __, ] badass, who wants to try to run across this stage past the bouncers, oh god? Well, we'll call it british bulldog and they're ready to [ __ ] somebody up who wants to try it. You know, and the bouncers were all into it: yeah they were down man, they were super down and then and then and everybody wants to do it, but this one kid was just jumping higher than everybody else. He was just all excited and I just could see the kids excitement. So I said you, the kid was, like you know, very small. He was, I think, 19 years old, he got and I orchestrated the whole thing. So the kid lines up- and I said, I'm filming it- I said on your mark- go whatever the kid runs, it was pretty anti-climactic. The kid just ran right into the bouncers and they grabbed him right, but as an afterthought, sort of and clearly on the own, the bouncer's own initiative, two of them together they lifted this kid up in the air and [ __ ] body slammed him on the stage and yeah and, like they body, slammed the kid like largely onto his head. You know, and he was the kid was knocked out: whoa unconscious. He was just twitching on the stage unconscious. I think I think he was like bleeding out of his ear like, and you know it was a [ __ ], pretty bad scene man. It was a pretty bad scene and, like you know, the whole purpose of the clowns in the circus is for when uh, when somebody falls off the trapeze or whatever the clowns are supposed to run in and divert attention. You know that was the whole purpose of clowns. You know like the show's got to go on the clowns come in, be like hey, you know we're good yeah, we're all you know so. I've got this like built in the show must go on and so dude the kids are twitching on the stage and I say under the microphone or whatever the kids are being loaded into an ambulance at that point, and I go that kid's on a stretcher being loaded into an ambulance. Is that what we came here to see everybody's like yeah? You know it was just. It was just not not good. So the the kid who uh the the person who was videotaping, this performance was uh. You know felt like okay, I've documented something with this camera that's probably like, and they gave it to the news then when they gave it to the news. The news was like: oh, this isn't as much of a news story as a crime and then the the the new. So the news passed the tape on to the uh, the on to the the city attorney and the city attorney was like: oh well, [ __, ], this guy and uh and said they charred and by the time the charges were filed. I was back in los angeles and um, and so they said they put me on the fugitive list right. But here's the thing that the fugitive I landed at number one on the fugitive list by a mile by a mile dude, because the [ __ ] uh they tried they set my bail for the charge of principal to second degree battery. You know it was a felony for for orchestrating the thing where the kid got slammed on his head and they they set the bail for that at 200 dollars, wow uh or or was it a hundred and twenty thousand or I uh one point one t 120 thousand dollars. I think it was or 1.2 yeah. I don't know something like that, but they also charged me with felony obscenity for stapling, my balls to my legs to the parish and they're. Like you know, that was that felony, a felony obscenity, I've never heard of such a charge. You're! Well right I mean there are there. There have been notable charges. Um, jim morrison was charged with felony obscenity in florida. I think for showing his wiener on stage. Uh lenny bruce was charged with felony obscenity. Two live crew was famously charged with felony obscenities so that charge that charge added me to the list of american heroes, fantastic yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah and uh, right and and and they set my bail for the obscenity charge at a full one million dollars. So I I landed on the felony fugitive list with like 1.2 million 1.12 million, I'm not sure which dollar bail and that's the highest bill. I was number one on the list. They scooped me up and took me to the la uh correctional facility, and I want to mention too, that that's like uh uh, a little [ __ ] morsel of this juicy ass book that I wrote right and I've got my book. Not only is it just a crazy book, but it's a really [ __ ] great book, as evidenced by the five-star rating, that it's maintained on amazon right, I love just this book is, is so beautiful and [ __ ] up and crazy, and if you buy it from my website, stevo.com every copy is personally autographed and I loved I loved. I like getting my book out there. I'd love to get my book out there and my new gnarly special. You fulfill them directly. How is it you're able to sign each one? I buy the books with an author discount uh. They get they get. They get shipped to my house sort of like if I was a store like the same thing as if I was uh. You know a book bookstore and they shipped the books to my house and when I say I personally, I don't personalize them. They shipped in my house and I autograph every I sign every copy. I sign every I yeah I sign. I do. I spend a lot of time signing and it ends radford. You know I sign every copy, and then I and then my dude brings the books to the ups and ships them to our fulfillment house. So what is the name of the book? Stevo professional idiot, a memoir, wow beautiful and that's on amazon I'm going to buy that right. Now, I'm going to buy it right after that yeah I wouldn't buy it on amazon. I'd buy it from stevo.com, so you could have it autographed. You know you want to. You want to have the autographed copy, but for you my brother, I'll [, __ ] make one out next time. I see it dude I'll [, __, ] I'll, give you. I would love that I'll. Give you a special one. So here's what I'm going to encourage everybody listening to do, go to stevo.com, buy gnarly for ten dollars. It's gonna be an absolutely mind-blowing hour special and then, when you're done, zach can can can zach chime in again and just uh. Do you have an endorsement for gnarly? My jaw was dropped and I've seen a lot of crazy, [ __ ] in my 22 years of life. That is by far the craziest [ __ ]. I've ever seen in my life is that zach has been raving about the show uh uh behind the scenes he has been yeah. I appreciate that so much man. You know it sucks that we that we waited for so long for my triumphant return to the h3 podcast, but you know, but waiting that long. I really think uh. I think that we made another hit dude yeah. I think we made another hit. I can't I mean it's always a pleasure to listen. I mean you're you're, full of so many uh incredible stories and uh such a great guy. I love having you on here gnarly, when you're done, watching gnarly buy the book. Get it signed. Stevo.Com is your one-stop shop for steeple related paraphernalia yeah dude the book? You can actually use paypal. It's super easy to check out, but dude. The gnarly special is so [ __ ] up and full of [ __ ], dick and grievous bodily harm and [ __, ], graphic drug abuse and just criminal [ __ ] that if uh, if I put it out with paypal like it wouldn't last 24 hours, it'd, be shut down as pornography like porn sites, yeah porn sites, you can never use paypal, you know and uh, and it was it was only before we before we went live with it. So one of us had this thought. I wonder if that gets. If, if uh, if paypal shuts it down, then they shut down the whole online operation. You know we, then we can't sell anything. So we were like oh [, __ ], let's, let's ask about this and we did a little poking around and it turns and turns out that you have. We had to have uh special bank approval, with a special account at a bank which has uh quote an appetite for high risk credit card transactions, which is what they call it yeah. What's wrong with that appetite um, I want to say it's in canada, somewhere um, but uh, but yeah. Basically any ban any uh like porn. You know like a webcam girls like more sketchy kind of cbd. You know like uh sort of dark web [, __ ], and that um is my is my explanation for why you you act have to do the it's just [, __ ] scheduled for that. How do you pay for the thing because I had dan buy it for me? Yeah, you gotta, you gotta put in the it's, not that weird you just have to actually plug in the credit card, and this is my this. This is my explanation. My apology for not having a quicker easier checkout is that that the quicker easier you know, paypal, amazon, pay, that type of thing would be more. It would be more convenient, but those people don't like uh porn, arguably bestiality when uh that rock hard [ __ ] elk is bloody, [ __ ], so was there actually was? Did he penetrate you? No, I I I didn't, have a hole in the the the costume I was wearing, but there's a scene where an elk uh is fully torched and humped. It looks like he was [ __ ] you dude yeah. That was like really interesting yeah, because I was like I'm not sure that you could legally show you're right being penetrated by an animal, but you did it um many uh paypal would have called that problematic, yeah yeah. That was, that was the first. That was the first thing and the only thing that would that really entered the conversation as hey. This gotta go, and I said I said: [ __ ] no keep looking for [ __ ] banks, we're gonna fight, we're gonna, we're gonna, find the [ __ ] bank, that's okay! With that [ __ ] rock hard elk butt, [ __ ] me [Music]. I love the idea of someone at the bank being like watching the whole special and then being like. We can do this yeah and then wait until the follow-up you know is ready. Everybody go to the same bank and be like okay. So now I'm actually [ __ ]. Now I'm at now. It's me that's hard and I'm [ __ ] coming everywhere and I gotta do it, but I think I think we're already in bed with the right partner. So yeah exactly I I I think you are. I think you found your partner for life there. Congratulations, I'm so happy to see you doing well. You've got your podcast. You've got all your specials and everything, and you know all your charity work and everything it's just so nice to see, and- and thank you man, thank you so much. I'm super happy did likewise man. I cannot tell you I I have told you, but I can't really like the the frequency with which I've heard about dude. I heard you on the h3 podcast, like the uh, the frequency with dude. I saw that [ __ ] you in h3, it's great man. What are you gonna do together? What's ethan really, like you know, like you know I I do. I hear it a lot and uh. You know I'm just stoked that I'm stoked that the world is the way it is that you know people like us can kind of take the power of the media into our own hands. You know like when I do certain podcasts and I think I probably did this the last time I was on with you. I said, hey like because with podcasting, you know, like retention is a thing. You know a lot of people. Don't stick around to the very end. You know like we have the audience fall off, but it's the hardcore [ __ ], like dedicated fans who stick around to the very end. I always address them at the end of every episode of my podcast wild ride with stevo, and I like to say thank you for sticking around to the very end of this podcast. You guys are the ones that really matter the most, and I always ask that my uh, the my I call them the street team. I say please take a screenshot of this podcast and and post it with tags. For me and my guests to let my guests know that they that you enjoyed it, you know and to kind of they made it all the way through and that uh and to help me get the word out and then build up this podcast, and that's why I call those people, the street team and so for the h3 street team um. You know I I want to ask you guys who made it all the way through to shoot me a tweet. Let me know that that you made it all right there. Let's do something they can send, which is like do like uh yeah. Are you not bad we're going to be putting it out with proper videos so really yeah? Oh yeah yeah that one okay. So so, if you guys watch all the way through to the end, send this image to stevo people there you go, the real ones know only the real ones. Now yeah dude yeah, it's something we should start up here: man, the h3 streaks. I like it, a lot dude! Yes, you know you want dude. I don't know when this goes out, but as we recorded this, like [ __ ] fresh, live on my uh podcast channel. I got mike tyson today. Oh I love mike he's such a [ __ ] guy.

Man, we've made some of our my favorite content. Together I mean I we were talking on the phone. You know I don't think, there's any other youtube video where they've uh successfully cut somebody's nuts off and the video is still on youtube. So we hold that distinction together, demonetized, but still there it's still there. That's what matters yeah. Still there yeah dude, my youtube channel is not big on monetization, oh yeah, that's still there right! It's still there dude! That's right. Have you got your uh diamond plaque? Yet how far? No the thing is we pivoted we don't really post on the main channel anymore. So right, so no we're we're not on the diamond path. Yeah, I'm still fighting the fight man I'm on both channels, but not but more regular with the podcast yeah. In any case, I think we've we've uh. What do you call it? Uh, we've digressed into personal conversation. We should leave, leave the street team to their business. Their hard work of promoting our shows yes and uh and they've got they've, got a gnarly comedy special to watch and a bug to read. Yeah you guys should click off and get on that. I agree. Yeah all right take care. Man appreciate you buddy.
